    "correct_answer": "You should bet around half-pot in this scenario. On a wet, dynamic board where the nuts are likely to change, your opponent will be more inclined to fast play their strong hands. By betting around half-pot, you incentivize your opponent to raise with their strong hands and call with their weaker ones. This allows you to get more money in the pot with your value hands and also gives your bluffs a better chance of getting through.",

    "correct_answer": "In a multi-way pot, you should choose a smaller bet size compared to a single raised pot. Since your opponents are less likely to raise their strong hands, especially if they are not first to act, you need to use a smaller bet size to incentivize them to raise their strong hands and call with their weak ones. In this scenario, you may want to bet around a third of the pot or slightly less, rather than a typical half-pot bet in a single raised pot.",

This allows you to get maximum value from hands that are unlikely to fold. For your bluffs, you should generally check, as your opponent is unlikely to fast play their strong hands, and you have no way to get them to cap their range.

In deep-stacked situations, there may be spots where your opponent's range composition isn't going to change much between a 2.5x pot bet and a 6x pot bet. If your opponent is still going to call their strong hands and fold their weak ones in a similar fashion, the larger overbet can become the most profitable play, as it allows you to maximize value from their strong hands. Understanding this concept of diminishing returns can justify the use of massive river overbets as a powerful tool in deep-stacked poker.",
