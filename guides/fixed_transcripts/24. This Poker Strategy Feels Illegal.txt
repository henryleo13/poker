this poker strategy is so profitable it should be illegal and I'm going to show you how to use it this helped me earn
over seven figures plane and to prove it's not a fluke I'm going to bring in three high stakes Pros who also swear by
this strategy we've got yolan Darius and gin let's meet the players we will start
with yolan he guys my name is yolan Ken I'm mainly I life players right now and
I'm playing between 2550 and sometimes some Myers takes uh like 125 250 500 and
last year I made over $400,000 playing life poker all right next up we've got Darius I'm Darius Uki
poker I have won over half a million playing cash games in my life uh made a dollar a hand playing ignition a couple
years back through Co yeah now playing 2550 and 500 live in Sydney last but not least we've got gin not only a poker
Crusher but one of the best synchronized rugby players in the entire world hi I'm gin I'm the co-founder of Hungry Horse
I've been a professional poker player for more than a decade I've played high stakes online up to 2550 NL and I have
played up to 400 800 with some $600 straddles in live poker and made 500k
Plus for many years of both live and online play so I'm going to have all of
these Wizards play a few hands but there's a catch I'm going to have them play each hand Twice first when they
have value and next when they have a bluff just how balanced are these high
stake super Pros going to be I have a feeling you're going to be surprised
let's jump in all right so every hand we're going to be playing 1020 4K effective so 200 big blinds and unless otherwise noted the villain in every
hand is going to be a trying recreational player so not really a fish not really a pro someone who is trying
to win maybe a break even player or a small winner going to be kind of a common archetype in live poker at these
Stakes very firstand here we are on the button with pocket fives we're going to open it up to $60 and the big blind a
Tran wreck is going to call flop comes 1085 so we flop bottom set he checks it over to us walk me through what you are
thinking here on this flop so I think we po at five all we have obviously a very strong G on this board we will want to
choose a bigger size and against a trying recal player that's will also be I think the best size we just want to
build a bot here and we will have a lot of draws in op pery region later to make big size and get cold by week ah hand so
I think here we five I'll bet 150 here so we go 150 and opponent calls we're
going to a turn which is an offit three and now the opponent checks I think here
will go really really big uh in general people don't really like to F top pair on the turn so I think I will go
somewhere around 1,100 um so I can have like close to a bside bet on the river and that's why I want to size really
bigs because I think the main calling region will be a 10 or com and I don't think this end fall against a very big
sizing so we go 1.1k he calls now the river is an offit Ace and he checks it
over so give me your thoughts and your decision on this River uh I think the river is a bit complicated I clearly see
two options here I see uh the smaller size option to Target a 10 so betting around 900s I can also see the bigger
sizing here like o Ling simply to get called by T plus 10 often going to raise the Flop he might have some like A8 A10
but I think the number of 10s here is um higher way higher than the number of two pairs so I will just tend to size down
here and and 900 get called by a 10 Okay so 900 all right same exact spot except now we have 7even six of spades on the
button same flop here walk me through your thoughts I will turn in live games to play this type of bluff in the
checking line simply because you gain EV by having ends in lines that people don't really see you on and here with 76
we will realize we couldi quite well in the checking line cuz we can call bat all the time on the turn uh rual players
don't use over bats in off on the turn and my hand can play well as a call on the turn raise on the river depending on
the size so I think I'm going to have more clever when I check the turn and I will be able to make a better Bluff when
I check the Flop the turn is an offit three and now the vill comes out and Bets 100 here on this turn pretty clear
coal I think this sizing represents mostly a 10 I still expect two per plus to bet the bigger size but I think I'm
going to have more clever on by coing here and depending on the river size I can raise my hand or simply F my hands
and facing check here I will bet on the river river is an offit Ace and now our opponent takes a second and then he
checks we are not going to see trap super often so we need to be not scared about that I will just try to Target to 10 and make full of 10 all the time so
um I'm probably going to size like 960 actually all right now I'm just curious I'm going to give you a third hand here
actually now we have Ace Deuce of Clubs in the exact same spot flop comes the same once again walk me through your
thoughts here throughout this hand I think I also prefer to check to be honest it's a ball where when we bet on
the Flop we will have a lot of huchi mostly on turns and rivers so we can apply in this case a lot of pressure to
a cap range however I think when you check here people will see you less on flushes and it's easier for him to call
the racing on the turn or to call the rise on the river or both simply because I expect my range to have way too much
Ace clubs X in a bluff and so I expect him to probably call a little bit more
than what you shoot in the spots and I don't think when I bet the Flop and the clubs came in uh people tend to overall these spots and the turn is a three our
opponent comes out and Bets 100 okay um I think here we can just call uh we will have a lot of Clarance on what to do on
the reiver so I don't think I want to raise and also the reason why I'm playing check on the flat because I believe on this board when I check uh my
opponent will give me more information and I will take decision all more clant and this will lead towards a higher R
decision so I'm just going to call here even if I consider raising possible we are going to call we get to the river in
the same way here and the river is an ace giving us top pair and now our opponent checks not something I say too
much but my sizing will depend on his timing because someone who snap check is not the same as someone who think a lot
and check because it means two different range super often and people are really honest with the timing in the live
environment let's say I don't have any information or his let's let's go through both actually I find that interesting let's go through first if he
snap checks and then if he takes a little time in so if he snap checks I will assume he has close to zero trap so
I will just eliminate A8 A5 is fre from his range and when he TS a lot I will assume he has way more either give UPS
or hand out or close to bats when his s check I will assume his range to be quite 10/ week oriented and I would just
bet a smallest size here to get sure uh I'm getting cold and here it's very important to make a size where the
opponent is going to think you can have value Cuts if he doesn't tank too long I'll tend to B around 120 140 to get
cold by a 10 and if he tanks a lot I think his range is a bit more polarized I think like T check it's going to be a
bit more toward the like stronger region of the probing range of the turn so I will tend to like size up a little bit
compared to when his s check where I think his range will consist more of a that are an easy check here so if he
does snap check you're going 120 yes and he thing check I go 150 here 160 all
right so first hand yolan obviously not balanced playing Bluffs and value wildly differently I thought this River
decision with the pocket fives was super interesting because there's two portions of villains range we could Target yolan
elected to go 900 here trying to keep in the king 10 Queen 10 Jack 10 109 type
stuff I think the other option here on this river which he talked about is just jamming all in targeting all of the AC
10 ace8 of clubs ace3 of clubs maybe even sticky acex of clubs that may not
fold to a river Jam here when the sprs W but either way thought this was a pretty interesting spot also thought yolan took
a super interesting line with this 76 where he elected to check back the Flop Call the turn and then 3x pot the river
I think this is pretty creative and I think it's a pretty cool line my default in this spot would probably just be to se bet on the Flop bet big on the turn
and then when the river in Ace here I'm just trying to get hands like 10x to fold that are going to shrink up in
value here so on this River my value size would either be very very big like 2x pot to Target the ace 10 ace8 of
clubs ace3 of clubs or my value size would be very very small here to Target like King 10 Queen 10 Jack 10 Etc so I
think going somewhere in between just to try to get the 10x to fold and to make sure we lose the minimum against the two
pair portion of the range is somewhat interesting so I'd probably go somewhere around the Thousand vicinity on this River so I would have played it slightly
differently than yolan but I thought he had a super interesting and creative line here all right so we're on the button with Ace Jack of Spades going to
open it up to 60 and the villain a try and wreck in the big blind is going to call flop comes Queen 74 with a couple
Spades so we flop the nut flush draw walk me through what you're thinking here starting from the Flop so mostly
just range betting this flop functions really well and keep my options open on turn and River bet 40 here he is going to call we go to a turn which is a deuce
of Spades he checks it over and at this point we have the nuts what are you thinking here on the turn now I'm looking to get the max from Top pair
looking to get the max from lower flushes so just going to be betting a size that targets those hands I don't
think on a flush Close turn Queen X is going to really raise for me very often so I just bet 3/4 150 got it so we go
150 they call now the river is an offit 9 and he checks it over and now just going the biggest size I think top pair is going to call um someone like king
queen king Jack betting 400 here we want top pair to never fold on this River yes yeah all right this time same spot
except we've got 65 of diamonds this time so we flop an open-ended straight draw walk me through what you're
thinking here starting from the Flop are you doing anything different here on the Flop or you're just you're just kind of simplifying in range betting yeah
simplifying this flop especially yeah 40 functions pretty well I think cool so vill's going to call we go to a turn
same turn Deuces Spades and we still just have six High Here and Now villain checks it over now tons of Merit to down
betting they are going to raise their flushers they're going to raise a lot of their strong hands so if we go small and they call they aren't really going to have flushes on the river and then hands
like Queen X regardless of the turn size regardless of the line I think we're just still going to be out of Target on the river moving forward go small def
find their range and go from there I'm happy of value betting triple barreling this hand we do hit uh straight on the
river after we down bat and Define their range in that way so it functions especially well with 65 so size on the turn here so going 1/3 like 70 so we go
70 he calls River now a nine and he checks it over to us one more time they called they're capped I think they
mostly have like top pair as sort of the top of range unless they've randomly B two pair so just going a size that I
think they're going to fold the majority of the time and going 550 being over B notice again Darius playing his Bluffs
and his value completely completely differently the one thing I may quibble with if I'm going to get a little bit nitpicky here is when we do have the ace
Jack of Spades I might go a little bit smaller on the turn because I think if we start going 150 villains will slow
play with hands like Jack High 10 high nine High flushes here on the turn if we go too big not because they're trying to
trap us or something it's just because they get a little bit scared that we have a higher flush Live players are going to be a little bit too passive
they're going to go into kind of this check call Shell so if they have a smaller flush and we bet 150 here they may just call and then we're going to
get to the river we're going to think oh you know what they don't have any flushes cuz they didn't raise a turn then we just don't get max value the cool part about betting like 35 40% pot
on this turn is when villain has a flush they will almost always raise and then if they don't raise we know we're just
targeting like top pair Hands On the River so it gives us a little bit more information they put in more money for us we still get to cooler their flushes
so I may just go slightly smaller on this turn and you heard Darius even say when he had 65 of diamonds here he went
small on the turn to make sure villain would raise off their flushes I think that's also good when we have the nut flush ourselves all right this hand here
we open in the cut off to 60 buttons going to three bet to 200 we are calling 964 with a couple of diamonds we check
it over and button actually checks back we go to a turn which is the King of Clubs walk me through what you're
thinking from this point forward let's hear it so as soon as the Flop goes check check I think a try and wreck in
this spot particularly on a board like 964 which is going to have a lot of like strong ace high they're going to probably be under three betting pre flop
going to be a lot of Ace King and I would expect that a lot of hands like Aces kings queens Jacks very high
frequency bet on the Flop I'm going to check here to evaluate their sizing I think I'm planning on trying to maximize
fold Equity with a check raise a 4K effect I got plenty of money to work with I think I'm checking here evaluating their bet size looking to
check Ray start to really put a lot of pressure on one pair hands so we check and he goes 300 here on this turn not my
favorite size I think we were expecting a fairly chunky bat here the really important question here is just spr
management just making sure that if we are going to pull the trigger here that we don't back ourselves into a corner on
the river in terms of so if we check raised to say 1,500 here well now the pot's going to be 3500 and we're just
not probably going to have a big enough bet back here they're probably going to check raise to about a th000 here I
think which should give me a pretty large bet left on the river I think that's going to allow me to Target One
Pair of Hands while maximizing F Equity still giving me the option if I do hit my hand on the river to size down to
Target hands like this he is going to call the river is in offit three look at
that and we have sweet baby there I believe we almost have a straight we have four cards to a straight I think
that's worth 3/4 of the part uh obviously we have no Showdown here I think we are facing a range that's going
to be primarily Ace King there might be a little bit of aces in range I have seen that hand check back I think if
we've sculpted the part appropriately there aren't really many other options to consider besides Allin feels like
I've set up pretty reasonable spr here I think trying Rex are some of the best players to Bluff I think those are the players who under bluffing themselves
often put their assumptions on other people I think I'm putting the money in all right same exact spot except we have
pocket sixes and we flap middle set here so once again flap goes check check we
are starting from the turn which is an off suit king walk me through your thoughts well I think their range is of course still the same I think we're
talking about a lot of Ace King perhaps a little bit of Ace queen I'm a little concerned at this uh spr that a check
raise is going to generate perhaps too much f Equity if I check raise and then
try and put all the money in on the river I'm a little torn here I think the two options that I would be immediately
considering would be large over bet and then follow that up with a big bet on the river or I would be considering
check race probably slightly larger trying to drag that SP ideally under one and then either consider sizing down if
I think I'm playing against a player who is perhaps slightly more risk ofers and over folding and if I think I can be
extra greedy slightly larger turn check race try and play for all the money on the river the B meating between those two without any clear reads I think most
of the time when I'm playing against trying Rex I try and put the money in for them I think I'd be going with it over B I think something around 1,000
and on the river don't think after just leading turn the draw bricking on the river that I would feel particularly
comfortable trying to make them fold a hand like Ace King taking this line that I think reduces fold equity and probably
just putting the money in well what do you know gin took the exact same line I would take here playing the Jack 10 here
on the kingx turn as a Jack Ray going for that Max fold Equity just figuring villain's going to be very very Ace King
heavy here on this turn and if they do have a hand like Ace Queen they're probably going to stab here so they'll put in more money for us and we can
always get them to fold the best way to get villain to fold a hand like Ace King here is to go for the check raise in the jam River this maximizes fold Equity
then with pocket sixes gethin taking my preferred line and just going with the big overb Ace Kings just never folding
sure we lose a bit of value from Ace queen that may just stab here but I think this just maximizes value against villains range where they're just going
to have so much Ace King here it's is never going to fold if we just take the lead ourselves remember leading
minimizes fold Equity check raising maximizes fold Equity even if a similar amount of money is going into the pot
all right next spot here we're going to open 8 seven of Spades in the cut off the button once again try and recreational player is going to three
bet us to 200 we're going to call and flop comes 109 Deuce with a couple of
Hearts so we flop open-ended here we check it over to the villain and he is actually going to check back we go to a
turn now which is an ace let's start playing the hand from here walk me through your thoughts from this spot
going forward what I want to do here is BET extremely small so I can get call by end will call on the turn and for later
like A8 King n King Jack King 10 and when he's going to race I know that Aces
and a 10 is not often in this range so I will get rais by the weaker region so I can free bat again this range or like go
lead basically can play two lines so I can Target this region that seem strong but is actually not facing um B small
Free Bet here so I will go more for 100s and if you raise I will free the turn here so we go 100 here on the turn and
he raises to 400 tell me what you're thinking it's very difficult to know the best line between freet the turn and C
the turn plus lead there's a lot of reever we can lead I can lead for volue bet on a six or on a jack on a heart I
can Bluff uh he's not going to have any 10 play this way so on a 10 for example I can just like DK for a very big size
and I think here I will actually go for the the free bat the problem with the free B size if you go too big it's going to be very difficult to know what he's
doing with Ace Queen a sh King because a lot of players going to follow the turn so what they call on the turn is actually very strong and you're just
going to isolate yourself against a at 12 basically just put the chips in the middle as soon as you bet on the river I
think here's a free bet I will go around probably 900 to get sure to get cold and I will just jump actually most reverse I
will jump on the queen I will Jack on the 10 I will not jump the king I will not jump the ace uh I will jump every
hot combo that he might have cuz I think flors arguing to B too much and I'm going to jump basically every blank here
to Target a king specifically and when you're raise is smaller size what's going to happen is when he's going to have like very strong end for example
like let's say he check back po or pois he's just going to rease so you delete the s from his range this is a really
cool line I didn't even think about this this is really cool he is going to call River is an offit three so I'm juming
here I think we're going to Max Pressure Ace king a queen and as I said I don't think most like sets and two are going
to be in this line so yeah we'll just go link here and Max Pressure Ace King Ace Queen all right now let's say the river
is a six and we actually get there on the river how are you thinking about playing this spot now on the river after
bet three betting on the turn if for a very big luck box on the rivers and I will tend to size down here simply
because when I choose the all in I expect him to overfall compared to what he should call so it makes no sense to
play Bluff the same way I I will go for 800 to be sure I'm getting C by an ace 800 all right now same except we're
going to have pocket nines once again we open the button three bets we are going to call we're going to check on the Flop he checks it back turn is now an ace
walk me through what you're thinking from this decision Point going forward I'll bet 100 also so you go 100 villain
raises to 400 and what are you thinking here after he raises I think I just raised 9 I don't want to be balanced in
this spot but like both of the S makes a lot of sense to play this way the only lines where you're going to be un Balan
in the river basically like on the turn I don't want to get to fall because I want him to call the small on the river
and when I Bluff I don't want to get a f because I'm just going to jum the river prob Pock KN you have a bit more incentive to like raise a bit bigger I'm
going to raise a little bit bigger actually F at nice I'm going to raise 1,000 River the three I'll size 800 800
okay with value here this is maybe one of the only points I kind of disagree with yolan here I think I would probably
just lead myself very very large I guess the downside of kind of just leading very very big is we lose value against
hands like King Queen of Diamonds it just would have stabbed or a hand like like 9x that would just always call the block bet but I think those hands are a
smaller portion of his range than hands just like Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack and those hands even for a massive overb
here are just never going to fold so I always like to talk about the way to minimize fold Equity is just bet
ourselves the way to maximize fold Equity is actually to go for a check raise and so when we have a very strong value hand here I just like to lead
ourselves very very large on this turn I think going smaller than 2x pot would be a massive blender because I don't think
a hand like Ace King or Ace Queen is ever folding to one bet they checked back the Flop they made top pair they're
not folding unless we check rais and jam the river right so I would just go bet the turn and then I choose a reasonable size on the river but also agree with a
lot of the reasons behind yolan strategy like I think the Black 3 Bet definitely has Merit but I think just so much of
his range is going to be ax here we maximize value against that portion of his range by just going big bet big bet
in this node all right next hand here we're going to open on the button with pocket dues to $60 why did I call them
Ducks big blind's going to call we flop bottom set he checks it over to us let me know your thoughts going through this hand starting from the Flop let's hear
it it's damn hard to fold pair on the Flop it's damn hard to fold like top pair especially kind of for any size we
have a ton of Bluffs available also happens to function well in Theory s of just for all the reasons I'm saying I'm going to be going for like a big overb
with value 180 I don't want to like get 8X to think about folding too hard so we got 180 and villain is going to call
turn is a four and villain checks at this point yeah so same idea uh top pair and stuff is still calling got a ton of
drawers available we're very deep so we do have incentive to try to get all the marbles going to be over betting again
just call it 750 750 and villain is going to call very interesting River it is a nine pairing the top card and
villain checks it over to us once more here on the oh just the dream to I mean we have so many P Bluffs in range with Jack 10 Queen Jack if they are even
thinking about that sort of thing and if they have a nine they're never folding they might even call an eight at this point if we have some sort of aggressive
image so yeah we're just ripping it in all in oh then yeah don't see any other option all right same exact spot except this time we've got 10 seven of hearts
and we flop a straight flush draw big combo draw here on the Flop walk me through what you're thinking yeah so sort of the inverse like comparing it to
the first hand we're doing like a lot more polarizing on the turn like if we have the big size option I would actually just like to go small here if
we start going bigger a lot of stronger flush drawers could still be calling anyway and we're kind of owning ourselves we are getting stuff like pocket sixes pocket fours to fold more
often might just go 40 here and go from there he is going to call and the turn is a four once again checks it over PT
is 210 now what are you thinking they got a Wier range there still a lot to charge and deny I would like them to
start folding adx and stuff so now at this point I'm leaning towards an over bad going somewh like 300 here and just expecting more folds cuz their range is
wider cuz we went smaller on the previous street so we go 300 he is going to call and we get to a river now which
guess what the river is nine there we go it's a nine I can I got this I can see the future man what are you thinking on
this uh this nine here how you feeling I'm thinking in this particular case uh I just give up um I'm just going to be
checking at this point with the overb the range is pretty defined 9x isn't folding I would need to be really short
sure they're going to have a lot of adex or wher hands and be folding them and I just don't see it so once again Darius playing his Bluffs and his value very
very differently here which I can get completely on board with the one thing I may change in this hand with the 10
seven of Hearts here getting to the river I do think villain's going to have a lot of hands like acex of Hearts Jack
10 King X of Hearts Queen X of Hearts Etc and all these hands if we just go check check on the river we lose to all
of this stuff which kind of a disaster with ten high now of course villain just going to have a ton of 9x here but I
think the really cool thing is we can just go very very small on this River we can just breathe on this pot maybe 200
maybe even 150 get villain to fold his Jack High Queen High King High ace high on this River and if that is the case
then our Bluff might just be printing so even with a bad combo I may still Bluff very small on this River just to clean
out his kind of draws that missed that have better Showdown value than our 10 high all right so in this one the button
a rag actually is going to open and this is a solid rag he's winning a 1020 probably not beating like 1K NL online
but he is good enough to beat a 1020 game so he opens 260 and we are going to defend in the big blind with pocket
fours the Flop is going to come Queen 84 pretty good for us we flop bottom set here going to check it over to the pre-
Flop Razer he's going to go 50 GTH walk me through what you're thinking in this spot Queen 84 is just a really deceptive
board in terms of there's so many hands to pull Bluffs from so this feels like a spot where people often perceive me to
be over bluffing I've got so many 10 n 5 sixes just so many gut shots so many
flush draws to pick from I'm really excited obviously bottom set one of the best value hands I think I'm going to
start building a pot right now obviously we're really deep the spr is really high I'm check raising pretty large here I
think when someone bets 50 they are range betting there's going to be a lot of hands that are just folding whatever
size I check raise and a lot of hands are going to perceive me to be over bluffing I think I'm probably going somewhere around 400 okay so we got 400
he calls turn is a look at that sweet baby there obviously that does bring in a couple of my gut
shots but I still think this is a spot that is easily perceived to be over bluffed obviously I have a very strong
hand I'm looking to play for Stacks want to set up a less than one River spr I think betting somewhere around a
thousand especially in live poker where low friction bet size has turn to perform pretty well I think 1K on the
turn here targeting Queen X draws just trying to get a less than one River SP and he calls and the river is pretty
good for you oh no I'm now losing to Queen 8 I think I just have to check fa
now this is a really great card reducing the number of perceived combos of value
that I can have in this situation I think a lot of people would likely be over bluffing in this situation I think
any reg who's worth his salt at 1020 has seen this spot Fair number of times can
just count all of the 109 all of the Jack n all of the missed heart drawers I
get to here I think this is a spot where I made a plan on the turn I've set up a River spr I'm just putting the money in
there you go I lost he SN called he has Queen eight oh my God I overplayed it all right this hand we are playing
against a rag or a pro not a trying wreck with 64 of Hearts we flop a bottom pair and a flush draw we check it over
he bets 50 walk me through what you're thinking I've ruled out folding I think
this is a hand that obviously has some Showdown I would say when I see a $50 bet from a button open I'm expecting
this to very likely be close to a range bet which means that I'm ahead of a DEC portion of that range obviously there is
some arguments for a check race I think I would mostly play cheze call with this amount of Showdown I know I'm going to
get to see a river pretty much whatever I think I'm just playing cool turn is in offit 5 we check it over and now here on
the turn he double barrels for $150 American Doll okay when a reg's double
barreling here I think The Showdown of my hand is diminishing I don't think it's non-existent but I think that when
I see 150 on this turn I expecting to see more maid hands than obvious Bluffs
I think if I want to maximize fold Equity turn check raises tend to perform
very very well we're pretty deep in this hand check Ray here with this much extra
backup Equity feels very very tempting check call can't bad think come in Camp
check Ray I think this is going to put a lot of pressure on hands as strong as
Ace Queen if we go for turn check rise there's going to be some disguised River is where I'm going to hit my hand I
think I'm not going absurdly large against a w here I think I do kind of want them to call turn and have more
options on the river I think I'm probably going somewhere around 600 hit my hand the river is an eight I've made
a full house that is a uncomfortable River obviously I think against regs
they're going to recognize that this may be reducing some combos of value in my
range I don't think it's the worst card I would not expect them to be double barreling much aex I think obviously
there's going to be a Rick wols that I can run into one of the concepts that I think about versus regs is if you do
want a bluffer wck make them play for all the money and I think that in this
line having check cold flop check race turn and now a big bat on the river for whatever reason the patent monkey
abilities of Live players which tends to be pretty good this line is far less likely to be bluffed than the line where
you check raise the Flop bet the turn and bet the river this one's feels like a spot where I'm expecting this to not
work a ton of the time but I think enough think in this situation I have very little Showdown value I think I'm
going to put the money in although I am not loving it and those chips are going to feel a little heavy in my hand all in
we see here G check calling on the Flop check raising on the turn absolutely maximizes fold Equity against thinking
players and we see here Gan even though he got a poor River just figuring here that when he check raises the turn he's
just going to have so much fold Equity that it may not matter here it can probably get fill into fold hands like Queen X in overpays here specifically
when he leaves behind 2x pot so taking a very different line here when he has a
bluff then when he has value when he has value just check raising the Flop betting the turn betting the river and when he has a bluff here check raising
the turn instead of check raising the Flop we're actually playing against a pro or a rag in this hand not going to
be like a top Crusher just like an okay 1020 rake definitely beating the game but probably not winning online at like
1knl or something so not like a top boss rag but good enough to win in live poker so definitely thinking definitely
somewhat competent he's going to open on the button to 60 we're going to defend in the big line with Queen nine of clubs flop comes Jack 103 so we flop
open-ended we're going to check it over to the pre- Flop Razer now he's going to go $50 decision is on us so give me your
thoughts what you're thinking in this spot I will prefer to call this type of fans and just raise all their hands
simply because I believe I have more value to raise ANS that like seems a bit
more unconventional so simply because when I raise and like there is a Nate or there's a king will often see me on
Queen n so I assume that the even the check ring line will be a bit lower because he will always see me on having
the sense basically uh and also his setting is pretty weak so when you see this type of sizing so often going to
check the turn and I know I'm going to have massive on the river when it goes check check no matter the run out basically turn off suit five in the case
we assume he doesn't have uh like booket three booket 10 Jack 10 and you remove the check crazing region it's not going
to cost you much if he doesn't have this type of hands then leading start to make sense and the solers start to lead the
reason why I think it's interesting to think about this line I'm not going to say you should probably lead him here in
the spots without studying The Spot while the leads are going to apply extremely straightforward so going to raise the stronger hands going to call
the wck hands when you bet 50 he calls and you just like bet threee for spot on the blank he's just mostly going to fall
because he doesn't know the line okay so with all that being said you check in or leading I'm going to check the turn here recheck and now he goes 150 here what
are you thinking I think I will tend to check race here uh the main reason is because I expect pet t p Jacks free to
just like bet beer flop or turns I think he going to over ble at the pot with all the draws available so I will assume he
ranges a bit weaker more toward the ace 10 King Jack Queen Jack side I'm going to raise uh 725 here 725 and he is going
to call so the river is an offit Deuce what are you thinking I think my sh
also in the end depends on his timing cuz for example someone that TS a lot in Coal he doesn't have the same a as if he
calls a bit fast for example most draws as like a backup like King Nine Queen
nine king queen a queen of diamond many diamonds ands are going to call very
fast against the race because they're not going to free battle in so if it tends to call faster I will just tend to
think his ranges a bit weaker um and I will tend to just fire but so basically
I bet all the time but I'm not doing the same same size and I think his range is a little bit different if he TS a lot and Co it's actually a good sign like he
might have a hand that is thinking about free betting uh but we need to um
remember that his sizings are a bit weaker and we have enough certainty that he doesn't have the very strong region
uh so when he tanks goal I will assume his range is also a little bit weaker but not very much on the diamond side so
actually if there is a diamond he tanks a lot here I will tend to uh Bluff my hands and if he calls too fast I'm
probably going to give up here for seconds to a minute and then calls on the turn Okay uh it's mostly going to
have a close end between call and for the turn because yeah simply less aims that are going to be close between Co
and race especially playing with his size so I think it's some that where uh
that was a bit more scared about me potentially betting the river but he still decided to call uh and so this
type of people this population I think will F way more against soat and people that will call way more light in this
spots or probably people that see you on too much Bluff and that are confident that calling the turn is good so when
people T it's in good sign and I will just go for a very big sizing here and on the juice um yeah I think I will just
J here so basically in this spot when I'm not sure between 2K or J uh from all the a I review from online in lives when
I'm not sure in the spots between two sizing when I Bluff often the best size is the bigger one so when I'm not sure
between two size I'm always going to take the bigger one and here I'm I'm not sure so I'm not sure I take what I think
is the most conservative option so I just go in here all right now same exact spot playing against a ray on the button
except this time we have Jack 10 in the big blind here we're going to defend once again we check it over and once again he bets $50 walk me through what
you're thinking probably sizing around 500 550 is a bit better uh it will
polarize our range a lot and we mainly have pocket freeze Jack 10 and we have so many draws available that I actually
don't see him starting to fall and he should fall because if has a jack here like Jack s should not call against like
a l race so I would just tend to raise bigger here and then raise around 450
450 450 and he is going to call going to a turn which is in offit five now what
are you thinking by the sizing so I get sure to get call by the region I dominate like Aces for example so I
would just bet here around 1,000 here so thep is below one it's going to be
easier to get Co in the rever so I'm betting 1,000 here we go 1,000 and he think for a bit and calls river which is
an offsuit Deuce give me your thoughts I think with his size on to flop I I will assume often people are bit weaker but
considering he called both the check race and the turn call we assume his range is probably bit weaker than what I
think he's mostly going to have a CH or 10 here mostly a CH so I will tend to
size a way that I let him think he has twoo good pot to fold so I'm not going to take the risk to jam simply because
if you jam in these spots when you don't have the absolute nuts of very very strong ends it has like more than n5%
Equity the pl in these spots is uh getting C by nothing is very very bad even if these scenarios are going to
happen not that much I will take to be very careful here about going to Big with a hand like Jack 10 I'll do around
1,300 I think yolan took the exact same line I would take in both of these hands which is pretty cool notice he went for
the check call on the Flop and then the check raise on the turn when he had kind
of a semi Bluff and this is because I found kind of these delayed gratification lines against Rags or kind
of thinking players work better than just check raising the Flop and just going bet bet bet in those lines I think
they kind of tend to get a little bit more sticky the cool part about check calling the Flop and check raising the turn is this line is just so massively
under bluffed in live poker if you're playing against an aware player they're just going to give you credit a lot more
for check calling the Flop and check raising the turn than they would if you check raise the Flop and then just go bet bet so I think this line is super
cool to check raise the turn and then Jam the river I think this just gets through quite a bit here and then we see
yolan played exactly the opposite when he had value takes this huge size on the flap because he correctly I think
deduces that villains are going to kind of put you on too many Bluffs here when you check raise the Flop as opposed to
the turn and then he's just going to put in a ton of money here across the turn and the river I might have gotten a bit
more greedy on this River and just tried to put the money in I really like how yolan decided to check raise the turn
when he had a bluff and check rais the Flop when he had value all right next hand here the cuto off opens to 60 with rebat on the button with pocket 10 cut
off calls comes 1053 pretty good for us flopping top set here he checks it over walk me through what you're thinking
starting from right here well there's a flash dra out there and I hate getting cooler so I rip it in and I just my G
just saying like half pot is like an appropriate standard like we really could bet any size but I think half pot's going to have like the flush
drawers still generally calling and not fill out the lower pocket pairs so I'll just go half pot here 220 turn is a king
and he checks it over it's a little bit unfortunate just because a lot of hands like a low run out would be better cuz
those pock pair is just going to be more tempted to call so I am expecting Bluffs to overperform now so the smaller we go
the more they're going to raise and the more likely they may just stick around since we have two 10 they don't have a lot of second pair like something like a
10 I would think would just probably very likely call a half Puck bet again they can still have all of the flush draws and stuff still possible they have
a set but less likely other option is just go like really big and hope they get sticky with a flush drawer yeah I'm
I'm leaning just to like 280 sort of sizing then in some raises from those flush draw still keep them calling on
the king specifically okay so rivers in Ace and now the opponent checks we are very close to the effective nuts not
expecting them to be raising like thin for Value when that much goes in people just get pretty nitty obviously we can have Queen Jack in range like that's
obvious so if they did have something like two pair they're not going to be ripping it are they going to be out of fold though I doubt it so probably just
ripping it in I think Ace five a three of diamonds Ace King off which Rex are going to have here a lot people just don't like for betting very often in
instinct is just put as much as I think those two pair are calling in yeah generally ripping is just worth so so so much more you want to focus on on upside
when you have a nut at hand it's just almost no exceptions I'm inclined to just be jamming so all in 3.3k all right
now exact same spot except we've got n98 of diamonds once again we three bet the cut offs open flop comes 1053 with a
couple diamonds he checks it over walk me through what you're thinking going forward same size functions fine I think
going smaller is also just totally fine we could even go a quarter pot i' probably go like 140 here why would you be thinking about going smaller smaller
they go The Wider they call and I don't think they rais that much more so it just sets them up to like overfall turn and River more often so we go 140 and
villain is going to call turn is a king and villain checks it over to us again
here what are you thinking I think they're going to be overing to any size life sort of just sucks for them this is our card uh going to be down betting
something like 280 keep their range wide enough that we can keep targeting it on Rivers almost like value bluffing at
this point trying to keep in 10x uh some mix of like pocket pairs just random 5x 3x they have flush drawers Ace Queen Ace
Jack so we are going to go 280 filling calls you're going to be shocked by this
River but it is an Ace and villain checks here on this River what are you thinking here the range is still like
plenty wide like they can still have plenty of those gut shots and stuff that hit but I think they do still have tons of 10x they could have a king like king
king queen back door now and then still like lower pocket Pairs and things of that nature I think we can get a pretty good price in now Bluff against like
second pair and worse I think half part actually functions like just fine I'd probably go like 640 something once
again we see Darius playing his Bluffs and his value very very differently in this pocket 10's hand here I make
consider a slightly different size on the turn Darius chose to go small on this turn trying to keep in hands like
pocket 9es pocket eights gut shots Etc I may actually just size up on this turn
Just Because unless we go very very very small when the king comes on the turn three bet pot we bet on the Flop we're
going to Barrel on the turn I think villains are folding hands like eights nines sevens all the time unless we go
like 15% pot or something ridiculous and when we have two 10 in our hand going to make it very very unlikely the villain
has a hand like Ace 10 or 10 or Jack 10 or something that will continue to small bet so I actually just like going big on
this turn I don't think villains folding hands like ax of diamonds I think they're going to have Ace King almost pure in live poker where they just don't
forb bet this hand from out of position after we three bet all that much and so let's target the Ace King let's target
the ASX of diamonds I just don't think those hands are folding so I would probably just go big on this turn to make sure we have a nice spr on the
River where we can just always get the money in against ASX of diamonds here and with the 98 of diamonds here like
darius's line going small here on this turn I think when small on the turn when we don't have pocket tens is pretty cool
trying to keep in that 10x trying to keep in Ace queen with the ace of diamonds all that type of stuff that's
just going to fold on the river the only thing I quibble with is the sizing here Darius went 280 I may go a little bit
smaller here maybe 150 just making sure the gut shot and the 10x don't fold here
on the turn I do think players are going to massively over fold a kingx turn in a three bet pot after we have three bet C
bet the Flop and double barrel the turn so I just want to make sure they have that wide weak range getting to the river then when the river is an ace I
made sure that 10x stayed in on the turn now I'm just going to choose the size that gets hands like Queen 10 Jack 10
109 toold which I think is going to be relatively small all right once again playing against a pro or a rag in this
hand going to be a winner at the 1020 blind level probably not a top level Crusher but definitely beating the game
so the cut off is actually going to open to 60 button the pro is going to three bet here we're going to cold four bet in
the big blind with pocket kges and the button is going to call Flom 75 Deuce
walk me through your thoughts from this point forward well I'm thinking I've got $3,400 back and the partt is
12270 and I'm thinking is this a spot for a three Street game or a two Street
game and how do I minimize fold Equity how do I shape and sculpt spr with Kings
obviously I am looking to minimize F Equity against a portional range Queens Jacks 10 possibly even nines I think
it's pretty tempting to size up here a lot of the time in Four B Parts it's hard to go too wrong with quarter I
think I might go like 800 I think that's going to let a less than one turn spr
giving me opportunities just to play a two Street game feels like on these Dynamic textures that I really want to
make sure that TS Jacks call and I think regs make pretty bad calling mistakes in
these tight configurations where they just can't fall an overpair to save their life let's get in 800 bucks we go
800 he calls turn is a seven he could have three sevens in his three bet call
of our four bet range this is bad news was that not good hand reading did I get that wrong that was great that was great
it's almost like you're reading the comment section obviously a blank turn uh I do think there's two pretty close
options in this situation like I'm trying to ask myself what happens if right I'm trying to step out of just the
hey I had a plan let's follow through and ask well what happens if I bet really small what happens if I put all
the money well the plan on the Flop was to sculpt to play a two Street game but I still think on a seven there is a
reasonable argument for sizing way down and trying to make this the three Street
installment plan against a reg I think I'm probably not going to over complicate it I think I'm probably just
putting the money in I think a lot of regs here are willing to call down with
a hand like queens and a hand like Jacks and I think they some s forget that that is the vast majority of their Ren in
this spot here and that folding tens here is not folding a monster it's in fact folding probably bottom 30th bottom
20th percentile of your range let's keep things simple let's follow through with the plan we made on the Flop we go all
in for 2600 all right same exact spot except we have Ace Queen of Hearts here
getting to this flop walk me through what you are thinking okay we have an spr of just under three I I think this
would be a spot where I'm looking to do my best to maximize fold Equity against
hands like tens Jacks maybe even Queens by the river I think I'd start here with
a very small bet trying to keep in hands like Ace Queen Ace King in our opponent's range I think something like
300 maybe even 250 is a pretty good starting point let's start with 300 on the Flop and evaluate I would expect him
to be calling too wide too much of his range versus this small bat we pick up some nice equity on the turn probably
sizing down again here portions of his range like Ace King that I suspect will
fold now and I think I have a pretty good chance against hands like tens and Jack if I pick maybe 500 on the turn to
call again I always try and remind myself about the best Bluff being they call twice and then fold on the river
really would like to see a heart on the river so that I can uh actually get some value but Mark's a real piece of work
and I suspect it won't be good news for you actually the river is a nine a you
piece of we don't have any new Showdown I think too often in four bet Parts people like to pretend a high is going
to have some Showdown obviously in this line it doesn't we can run into some
rivered full houses potentially I am uncomfortable but I didn't come to the
casino not to fight for every pop betting small makes absolutely no sense I think check just allows him to show
down too many hands just if I'm going to be bluffing a rag I'm going to try and make them play for all the money and I
think this is a spot here where I'm telling them three times that their hand is no good and that I am sitting there
with old pocket kges I think I'm just all in 2600 all right finally let's change the river and say it's actually
an ace of clubs now how are you thinking about this River differently this is an
interesting spot here on the river when we have Ace Queen of Hearts I think we reduce ton of potential Ace kings that
would have got here I think we have the best hand almost always I think this River makes bluffing extremely
challenging I think against a rig even your average 510 or 1020 reg that this
is going to be a spot where we are going to be perceived to be under bluffing so
my value size needs to be very small I think here I think if I'm looking to
Target a hand like ja maybe a hand like Queens I think I might even be able to
do something pretty fun like bet 10% pot some in the idea of betting like 300 on
the river maybe challenging their ego and manhood just a little bit something
like 250 to 300 feels like a pretty interesting idea to squeak out a little
bit of value and sometimes give yourself a pretty interesting option to bet call against someone who maybe thinks you're
betting Kings maybe thinks you're betting something worse than Ace King or Ace Queen and does something foolish
with jacks or 10 I think the 10% to induce SL squeak out a little bit of value from a hand like jacks or Queens
feels pretty tempting so we see here gin trying to play the two Street game when he has pocket kings just going big bet
on the Flop targeting the Jacks Queens tens Etc that just are going to overall on this flop or a big size like rigs
just aren't folding pocket nines or pocket 10 here even though to the size they should be at some frequency in a
cold forb pot here and just taking the big size on the turn again figuring playing a two Street game is going to
look a little bit more bluffy it's going to minimize fold Equity against Rags here and just trying to get in the money against a hand like queens or Jacks and
then when he has Ace Queen here going for the small bet on the Flop making sure villain calls with a hand like Ace King keeping that in going small on the
turn want to drag along hands like pocket TS pocket nines Etc here and then
getting to the river gethin now goes for the triple barrel which he figures looks much much stronger here than just going
for two streets and figuring has quite a bit of additional fold Equity here against hands like Jacks tens Queens
when he goes bet bet bet rather than just going big bet flop big bet turn this bet bet bet line actually going to
increase fold Equity over just betting big flop and then jamming turn all right so the big picture takeway for me here
I'm kind of picturing the midwit meme where the beginner is just like what do my two cards want to do the guy in the
middle the 100 IQ the midwit guy is just so lost with what is equilibrium how do
I be balanced here do I unblock my opponent's calling blah blah blah blah blah and we get to the top the super
high I Q the high staks pros and once again they're just asking what do my two cards want to do hopefully this video
shows in poker even at Mid and high stakes you probably should not be playing your Bluffs and value in the
same way hope this turns you into the biggest boy possible thank you guys and have a gentle day
