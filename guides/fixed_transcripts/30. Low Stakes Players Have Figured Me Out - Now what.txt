the low stakes player pool has figured me out well not really but they have
started making some adjustments so what if players in your pool start adjusting to you I'm going to show you guys some
of the counter adjustments I have been making and more importantly how to come up with these plans yourself I like to
think of Poker as a dance and if you can just stay one step ahead all of the pretty poker players will give you their
chips while they never mind let's jump in so here are some of the adjustments the strong
players in my pool have been making to me they've been checking their range out of position they have been not stabbing
nearly as much as the pre-flop Razer when I checked to them from out of position theyve been calling over bets
way too wide on rivers and they have been flatting a ton of strong hands pre
flop essentially to keep the recreational players in the pot behind so basically they've been trying to play
like me and I just want to emphasize I have been playing this way basically for 6 years and until I spent a year putting
content on the internet essentially saying hey guys here's the entire Playbook of how I play the player pool
did not adjust so don't overreact and start thinking the entire player pool is going to adjust to you on day one
because it will not happen I promise so let's go through the counter adjustments I have been making one by one and we
will start with what to do when opponents are range checking from out of
position so some of the stronger players in my pool I have noticed have just been range checking to me specifically in
single raise pots when they are the pre- Flop Razer and here is the adjustment I am making mostly on flops I am going to
play an over bet or check strategy where I am primarily going to be checking back
on the Flop and then on the turn after the flap goes check check once again if they check again I am again playing an
overb or check strategy now in extremely rare cases I am checking back my entire
range on the Flop so what does all this mean let's jump into a couple of examples and I will will explain all
right so we are playing two5 villain and a lowjack who is a strong player is going to open we flat on the button with
pocket nines here what do you know flop comes Jack n deuce and in this spot I've seen quite a bit in single race pot some
of the stronger players just checking their entire range to me trying to give me a little bit of rope to hang myself
so my adjustment in this spot has essentially been playing a big bet or check strategy where I am mostly mostly
mostly going to check back on the Flop and when I bet my bets are going to be extreme ex L polarized what they want to
happen when they check their range to me out of position they just want me to start going crazy with my air with my low Equity draws Etc and I am not going
to take the bait so how I'm going to play on this flop when I have very strong hands here like pocket NES pocket
Deuces Jack n suited maybe I'd even have a hand like pocket Queens on the button
here when a strong player opens from the lowjack if there are a couple of fish in the blinds we'd like to keep them in
remember no use really in isolating the very strong player flap so I'm just going to be betting my very strong hands
here for a very large size and then my hands with a ton of equity here my nut flush draws my combo draws like ace
deuce of Spades Queen 10 of Spades King 10 of Spades those are primarily going to be the hands I'm going to choose for
the big bet size here no real reason to over complicate it choose my very good
hands and my hands with a [ __ ] ton of equity and I'm just going to choose a very big size because I'm representing a
very polarized range here I'm not betting the middling portions of my range hands like Queen Jack ace9 etc
those hands are just getting checked back so you see here in equilibrium this strategy is actually going to be
approved if we lock our opponent to check their range on the flap you see the solver does not like to use this
small size and it is either using this big bet size or checking back which it is doing most of the time you see pocket
nines are mostly bet here pocket deuces are almost always bet here Jack n suited is going to be bet here the majority of
the time and a lot of the Bluffs are coming from High Equity Holdings hands like ace8 of Spades ace four of Spades
the other hands that we can consider going with the big stab here are hands that just don't really mind if they get
check raised off their Equity if we have a hand like 108 of Spades and we get
check raised here we just have a very very easy call because we have a mountain of equity against their range
that is check raising if we have a hand like pocket nines or pocket Deuces again we have a very easy call because we are
just most likely ahead of their range that is check raising and we could also maybe work in some hands like 8 seven of
hearts or 8 seven of diamonds or something like that here on the button because if we do get check raised well
we just have a gut shot it's not even a gut shot to the nuts we have a very easy fold if we get check raised here so if
we want to go crazy here and find more big bets on the Flop we can pull those from kind of our low Equity draws that
don't mind folding if they get check raised again we just want to choose hands that have a very very easy call if
we get check raised and hands that have a very very easy fold and if we do have a hand somewhere in the middle like a
king Jack Queen Jack Jack 10 typan I am mostly just going to be checking back
this flop because villain especially with a lowjack open here very tight range if they're checking their entire
range on the flap well they just have all the over pairs right they have Queens Kings Aces they have all the ace Jack Etc they have very strong hands
here so King Jack is a hand that kind of wants to check back here now on this flop and if our opponent comes out and
Bets a turn well we have a very easy continue now we've given them rope we are beating all of their Bluffs and if
our opponent checks again on this turn we are going to play a big bet or check strategy and King Jack now at this point
once our opponent has checked twice is a very very thick value hand we are just trying to get value at this point from
all of their Showdown value that is never folding to a single bet here if our opponent has a hand like pocket 10
or Ace 9 suited or pocket eights all of those hands would play this way where they would check their range on the flop
and now on the turn they would check again attempting to get The Showdown and mostly when our opponent has The Showdown value hands they are not going
to fold for one bet so if they check again on the turn here with King Jack of clubs I would most likely choose this
big size here on the turn after checking back the Flop so going back to our handy dandy little guide here you see on the
Flop playing overb or check you see on the turn after the Flop goes check check if they check to us again on the turn we are playing overb or check again you see
here in rare cases I said I would check back my entire range on the Flop so when does that apply we would have to be
playing against a villain who is capable of just massively over betting on the
turn and the river with their Bluffs if we check back on this flop if you are
against a player who if you check back on this flop that they may come out and just bet 2x pot on the turn and 3X pot
on the river with their air or their low Equity draws because they sense weakness it may just be a better more simplified
strategy to check back all of our hands on the Flop to give our opponent even even more rope now disclaimer this is
very very very rare right and I have not encountered this type of villain yet in
the entire player pool at 5'5 and to be clear this doesn't just mean the player is going to Bluff when you check back
the Flop right this means they're going to use massive overb sizes because that's the only way it is higher EV to
check back our super nutted hands on this flop like top two pair and sets is if our opponent's going to put in
massive over bets or massive check raises on the turn with low Equity draws and air if we check back the Flop I
would say for 99.9% of even live Pros that is probably
not the case so the over better check strategy on the flap is probably going to be the best strategy and probably
just throw the checkback entire range on the flap out the window unless you are playing against a true maniac and just
one last little caveat there are going to be boards for example like 9862 tone where the solver prefers playing a small
bet or check strategy because it wants to bet a lot more on these boards for me I like to simplify I like to play a
strategy that I can easily execute in game so I don't think it is going to be losing much EV by just playing a big bet
or check strategy on pretty much every board if our opponent is checking their range to us from out of position you see
here on 986 the solver just prefers using the small bet size basically when check to because it is betting so so so
much on this board but you see here if you zoom in and look at the EV look at a hand like AJ of clubs we are losing like
two cents by choosing the big bet size I think a simple strategy executed well is
going to outperform a complex strategy executed mediocrely and on most boards
the big bet or check strategy is going to be higher EV so I'm just going to simplify and play Big bet or check if my
opponent is checking their entire range to me from out of position all right the next adjustment some of these stronger players in the pool have been making
They Don't Really stab when I check to them from out of position so here's I've
been adjusting basically I've been asking where are they going to make the most mistakes and against Rags or Pros I
am just generally simplifying and I'm just range betting on boards that are good for me and I'm range checking on
boards that are bad for me so I will explain in one second and against passive wrecks who have Whiplash for me
check raising them so much and they're just checking back quite a lot they're not stabbing nearly as much I'm being a
little bit more exploitative against them I am just going to go ahead and bet my thick value myself but I'm still
checking my top of range my canay for Stacks hands and my Bluffs and I will explain why now all right so say we open
here in the cut off and a pro Flats on the button here when the board comes
something like King 7 deuce or Ace King 4 or Ace Queen 6 or something like that
a board that is perceived to be slightly better for us as the pre-f Flop Razer I am just simplifying and I am going to
just seet my entire range small here the reason why checking our entire range
from out of position is so profitable is because the mistakes players make generally they over stab Telegraph their
hand strength with their bet sizing and they do not protect their checkback range Rags or Pros are not making those
mistakes they're generally not over stabbing they're certainly not telegraphing the strength of their hand
with their sizing against other good players on these boards that are perceived to be good for my range I'm just simplifying and just betting my
range because I don't think our opponents are going to make as many mistakes versus a check and conversely
if the board is something like 9852 tone a board that is perceived to be better for the pre-f flap collar than the pre-
flap razor well in this case I am just simplifying and checking my entire range to the pro from out of position so
against Rags or Pros who aren't going to over stab when we check to them on good boards for us we just see BET our range
and on bad boards for our range even if it's good for our hand we check our entire range now where I think this is
more interesting is against recreational players who have adjusted to us just massively check raising them by checking
back quite a bit on the Flop they've gotten a lot more passive they're not stabbing nearly as much and here are the adjustments I am making against
recreational players now if I do have a thick value hand a hand like Ace King or
pocket aces I am just going to come out and bet myself because opponents have adjusted they're playing maybe a little
bit more passively they're not stabbing as much and a hand like Aces or Ace King is just quite happy going bet bet bet on
this board if they go call call call where we are going to have the best hand a very high percent at the time that hand doesn't really benefit a whole lot
from a check raise if they're not over stabbing and we are just able to get in a large amount of money by just betting
ourselves now say we're still playing against a wreck player here on the button and I do have a complay for
Stacks hand maybe hand like pocket 9es here or six s of diamonds or something like that even if they are not over
stabbing nearly as much I am still checking to a recreational player with a hand that can play for Stacks they are
still going to bet on this board when they have a hand like 9x when they have a combo draw when they have a nut flush
draw when they have two pair all of those hands are still going to stab so when we have a nutted hand checking
letting them stab and going for the check raise essentially allows us to get all the money in the pot whereas if we
just go bet bet bet it is much harder to get all the money in over three streets when we start 200 big blinds effective
so our complay for Stacks hands at the top of our range still benefit from going for that check raise and to be
clear on this particular board I am checking for two very different reasons against the recreational player and against the pro against the pro I'm just
checking my entire range because this board is slightly better for them against a recreational player I don't
give a [ __ ] about that and I am just going to be very very exploitative here and I am going to check with myay for
Stacks hands and my Bluffs and I'm just going to bet my thick value myself for example on this board if I had a hand
like pocket tens pocket Jacks I would just go bet bet bet because that hand doesn't necessarily benefit nearly as
much from a check raise especially if they're not going to be over stabbing a hand like pocket 9es really really really benefits from that check raise
here we can just cooler a hand like 98 pocket eights pocket fivs and get the money in by using a large check raise
where we would maybe not be able to do that if we just went bet bet bet ourselves also when playing against recreational players in the spot I'm
still going to check my draws my Bluffs my air because those hands also benefit from a check our opponents if they are
recreational player let's say they're no longer over stabbing because they're tired of us check raising the [ __ ] out of them that doesn't mean they're never
stabbing they are still going to stab when they have top of range on this board when they have pocket eights when
they have six seven suited when they have pocket fives when they have an over pair like pocket 10s they're still going
to bet their good hands what does that mean for our Bluffs well when we check and they bet if we have air or low
Equity we can just pitch it and get out of there even if they are under stabbing now because they're scared of getting
check raised that still gives us a pretty big clue when they check back because they are still going to bet off
their strong hands when we check to them so when they check back our Bluffs are still going to print so the adjustment
against ational players who may be slightly more passive we need to put in money with our thick value ourselves but
we should still be checking when we have the top of our range and all of our Bluffs all right the next adjustment
some of the players in the pool have been calling the over bets to wide we get to a river I overb they call it off
with second pair or whatever and I think hm what adjustments can we make here so
against these type of players who have been getting sticky who think I'm a maniac I'm essentially just using huge
sizes for thin value and with my Bluffs I am sizing down just targeting them to
fold hands like their ace high draws King High draws Etc when I have air so
let me show you a couple of examples all right so in this one we are going to open to 25 from the cff a rag in the
small blind makes it a 105 here and this player has been sticky against the big
bets so the Flop Here Comes Ace A4 he checks I am not not sure but if I had to
guess I may guess that this player is just checking his entire range from out of position because I've seen him check
twice now in a three bet pot on a board that is supposedly good for him so I'm just assuming that he's checking his
entire range I'm going to play a big bet or check strategy myself here this hand
really nothing going on so I am just going to check this one back the turn now is a king and he comes out and Bets
$30 like 15% pot here I think we have a pretty easy continue here our hand is
too strong to fold so we're going to call and see what transpires on the river now the river is a jack which
really changes nothing and our opponent checks so let's talk about our opponent's range here on this River and
I think if our opponent did have a very strong hand like Ace Queen Ace King something like that this is not the line
he would take right at some point he would start putting some more money in the pot whether it was on the turn or on
the river it looks like we have Showdown value when we check back the Flop and then call the turn so I do think if he had an ace he would just bet this River
at a high percentage of the time what type of hands make sense for him checking on the Flop we're not sure if
he's checking range but let's assume he might be and then choosing a small bet on the turn and then checking on the river well I think his range is pretty
face up on this River it's going to be a lot of hands like pocket queens and pocket 10 so this is a spot where
typically I would choose a very small size to Target a hand like pocket queens or pocket 10s because it just looks like
our opponent is weak and he can't really call here but because my image has started to become a little bit maniacal
and this player does not like to fold to me I don't think he is checking pocket queens or pocket 10 to fold so I'm going
to choose a massive size 2x pocket just going super super thin for a very large size because our opponent is calling too
much in my estimation all right one more example here we opening the cut off with a 10 off and villain on the button is
going to call flop comes King 104 and in this hand this is a recreational player
but he is thinking he is trying to adjust now if this was a pro on a king 104 board from a cutof open I would just
be betting my range here but against a recreational player even though he is trying even though he is thinking I'm just going to essentially do what my
hand wants to do here which is check and maybe go for two streets I am going to
check and our opponent is going to check back and I do think even though this opponent is probably not going to over
stab against us because he expects to get check raised quite a bit I do think he's still going to bet off his strong hands here if he had a hand like pocket
fours if he had a hand like King 10 suited even if he had a hand like king queen or King Jack I think that hand
would get bet here a high percentage of the time now the turn is a king and once
again my plan here on this turn is actually to check to give our opponent a
little bit of rope have him maybe stab with his gut shots his straight draws
his worst 10x whatever that he checked back on the Flop I think if I could redo this i' just come out and bet on the
turn myself here just targeting all of his Showdown value and maybe his draws to check back the Flop but I go for the
check again actually going for a turn check raise here for thin value and he checks it back now the river is an
innocuous Deuce of hearts and at this point I think when our opponent checks back the flap and checks back the turn he would just bet off all of his draws
at some point either on the flap or turn so he doesn't have a draw I think at a high frequency here our opponent is
going to have Showdown value right a hand like pocket n pocket eights maybe a worse 10x now if I was playing against a
typical opponent here who did not know me who had not watched The Hungry Horse videos who did not know I am absolutely
insane I may go for a small bet here targeting the weak portions of their range but this player does not like to
fold to me so I am going to choose a massive size here because I believe he is calling the over bets at way too high
of a frequency so my adjustment is just to go super thin I'm going to go 1 150 nearly 3x pot or opponent snap calls we
flip over the ace 10 and of course we are good all right so what do we do when
we have Bluffs well let me show you we open from the cuto off with 65 our opponent three bets in the small blind
again once again this is a for-profit player who has been quite sticky against us flop comes Queen 83 here and he
checks just backs up the assumption that maybe this guy is checking his entire range to us on the Flop when they're
checking their entire range to me on the Flop I'm going to play the overb or check strategy mostly check checking
back so that's what we are going to do with this hand here we check it back turn is now a seven of clubs giving us an open Ed straight draw when our
opponent checks again if he did have a hand like kings Aces Ace Queen I would assume at least some of the time his
good hands are just going to come out and bet so when he checks again here on the turn I think his range is going to be a lot of Showdown value and Showdown
value can take a couple of forms right it can be hands like pocket nines pocket 10 pocket jacks or it could also be some
ace high flesh draws maybe Ace King of Diamonds Ace 10 of clubs Ace jack of
diamonds just his kind of good ace high draws that he assumes here have some Showdown value after the Flop goes check
check he is going to check to us once again on this turn I am playing overb or check I would like to start piling in
money a lot of his Ace High flush draws may play this way he may even play this way with a hand like Ace King and just
call once here on the turn because the board is so draw heavy so I choose a big size he is going to call the river is a
deuce and when he checks it over against a normal opponent I would just be jamming on this River because I don't
think he can hang on with a hand like pocket 9es pocket 10s whatever but against this particular opponent who has
shown himself to be sticky very very sticky against the big bets I don't think the big boy Bluff is great here
and on this River with six high should we give up well no probably not we can probably still get his hands like Ace
King Ace Jack of clubs maybe to fold and we don't need to use a very big size to do that so I go 230 unfortunately our
opponent snap calls and he does have pocket 10 here but we're never targeting a hand like pocket tends to fold we just
want his Ace highs here to fold so that was the way I played the hand in game and I was okay with it because I didn't
punt a stack to a hand like pocket tens that was just never ever folding for all of the money but maybe there is another
way to play this hand that I thought about after the fact so I wanted to explain an alternative line here that
may be even slightly better which would be on this turn just checking back again
this incentivizes him after we check back twice to just come out and bet the river now if he has a hand like pocket
jacks or pocket tens on the river it just looks like we have pure Showdown value here right it looks like we have a
hand like 8X or 7x or pocket 9es or something like that that probably isn't
going to bet itself I think this just kind of forces him to come out and value bet the river if he has a hand like jacks or tens or something like that and
if he does check now we don't have a better clue on this river that he probably has a hand like Ace King or Ace Jack some ace high type hand with
Showdown value and I think one big bet on the River to get him to fold the ace highs I actually think this works at a
high frequency because number one when we check back the turn it looks like we have Showdown value and number two we
have eliminated a lot of the pocket Jacks 10 NES from his range because I believe those hands aren't going to
check three times here now they may check twice but they're probably not going to check three times so maybe just checking back twice and then betting the
river is the superior strategy and I didn't consider this in game but I thought about it afterwards so I just
wanted to give you guys this alternative option as well all right finally one more example of how thin we should be
going against these sticky players who just aren't folding to us so we open pocket Jacks in the cut off same player
is going to three bet in the small blind here we are going to call Queen 83 he checks it over and once again we are
playing big bet or check this hand is two in the middle now I may be betting
hands like pocket eights pocket 3es 91 of diamonds Jack 10 of diamonds Ace
three of diamonds hands like that on this board but this hand is just some more in between it's not really a very
strong hand it's not a bluff we've got some Showdown value this is more of a thin value type hand so I'm just going
to be checking this one back now on the turn our opponent comes out and checks again and at this point we can't say
with 100% certainty that he just never has Aces kings ace queen or something like that here but I think we can
eliminate a lot of it even though we know nothing about our opponent's range when he checks the Flop when he checks
the turn we now have a few more clues because what does it look like when we check back the Flop well looks like we have Showdown value so at this point I
do believe at some frequency he's going to come out and bet his hands like kings ace Queen pocket aces here on this turn
the hands that have us beat so at this point it is time to start piling in money with a hand like pocket Jacks so
I'm going to go with the big bet here on this turn our opponent calls the river is a deuce he checks it over and
remember when we had a bluff in the spot we did not want to jam on this River because we thought our opponent is just
never going to fold a hand like pocket NES pocket 10 here so because 65 of Spades does not want to jam because our
opponent is calling too much with pocket Jacks we have a very easy Jam for Value we Jam for just over pot here our
opponent calls and we are good in this fictional hand that I just made up for
your viewing pleasure all right and final adjustment here I've noticed some of these stronger players in my pool taking a queue from something I talk
about all the time and just flatting their stronger hands when I open especially when the rest of the table is
recreational players they want to keep those players in no real use to Isola me they want to keep the weaker players in
who are going to make 100 big line mistakes post flop when they are flatting some of their strong hands pre flop here are some of the adjustments
I'm making I'm opening wider from later positions say I'm in the hijack or cut off and they are in the button I'm just
opening more hands because we're not going to get three bet nearly as much I'm over folding to three bets because
they're just not three betting enough and when I make this adjustment against RS I'm using a polar range but it's hard
to find kind of the Bluffs if you're just not three betting a lot of the value so we'll talk about this in a
second and I will explain I'm also getting greedy with thick value when they flat pre- flap because they can
have some stronger hands in their range they can have some overpays they can have some suited Broadways and finally
being a little bit more careful with my Bluffs and thin value because their range is a little bit stronger than we
assumed if they are flatting some big pairs some suited Broadway stuff like that pre flop let me show some examples
so first let's talk about how I construct kind of a polar three bet range if a rag opens from early position and I am also early position or I am on
the button whatever and there are multiple fish behind me this may be my three bet range against a pro who opens
you see I'm only three betting the very top of my range here right kings ace King suited Aces maybe sometimes queens
and Ace Queen suited and then I am also three betting the bottom of my continuing range and when they open from early position I have a relatively tight
continuing range so maybe my worst Ace that would continue in Ace 5 suited and then some of my 10x type suited Broadway
hints King 10 Queen 10 Jack 10 109 something like that so it's a very polar range where I'm flatting with hands like
pocket Jacks Ace King off king queen suited Ace Jack suited these hands are the middle of my range against an early
position rig open and these hands want to Flat to let the fish in behind now let's say a rig opens in the cut off and
we are in the button it's the same idea here but our range expands both the top of my range here would maybe go down to
Ace Queen suited Ace King Jax all these hands would be three betting for value now from late position and you see the
bottom of my range now expands a little bit to worse hands as well maybe my King n King 8 ace6 and ace deuce hands like
that you see now that the ace 5 suited is just too good to three bet it is now the middle of my range same thing with a
hand like Jack 10 suited or queen 10 suited these hands are now near the middle of my range cut off versus button
why am I over folding two three bets from Rags when I've noticed they're flatting some strong hands pre- flop and really simple if we go back to our range
chart here it's really easy to find the top of range three bets it's hard to work in the Bluffs if we're flatting
with the middle of our range hands like our suited Broadways hands like our Ace 10 suited our Ace Queen off if we're flatting with the middle of the range
it's hard to find these polar Bluffs and just be consistent and always have them worked in there so if I notice a is
flatting a bunch of their strong hands to me I'm just going to assume for the most part that they're not finding enough polar Bluffs and therefore I'm
probably going to overfolded their three bets so now back to the list here let's talk about some of the other adjustments
why can we get greedy with thick value and why should we be careful with our Bluffs in thin value let me show you why
we open from under the gun with pocket aces and a pro is going to call next to
act here in the hijack now a recreational player is going to call in the big blind flop comes eight for Deuce
with a flush draw and when it checks over to us with one player in position to us and one player out of position I
don't think this flop is going to get stabbed at a high frequency from the rag here in position three ways so I am just
going to bet myself I bet small and the ray calls next to act and the wreck in the big blind folds the turn is a King
of Hearts which in game I consider this not a great card to continue getting
value because when the rag Flats pre- flap and then Flats next to act on the Flop I think a lot of his range is going
to be hands like 8X pocket 9es pocket 10s stuff like that particularly when we
have the Ace of Spades in our hand I don't think he's going to have a ton of flush draws here flatting and under the
gun open in the hijack I just think his range is mostly going to be pocket pair Heavy He's not going to like to see this
King on the turn I bet into multiple people including a fish on the Flop and now on the turn if I continue double
barreling I think it's going to be pretty hard to get value here so I actually elected to size down here and
this is a common strategy I take when a card comes that is very good for our range that makes it unlikely we are
bluffing but it's also going to be unlikely that our opponent will stab and take initiative if we give them rope I
just like to bet small to keep our opponent in there with hands like pocket nines Ace eight of diamonds Etc so I go
small here on this turn opponent calls the river now is a nine of Spades and at this point I think we're running out of
value I do still think we have the best hand some percentage of the time but this opponent is a pro he's not going to
call a riverb here when the front door flush comes in with a hand like Ace 8 or something like that so we are just
running out of value so I check he checks it back we turn over our hand and we are good and he actually has Ace King
here so he flatted with Ace King next to act which I like a lot I would do the same thing if he opened and there were
all recreational players behind but I was just kind of flabbergasted here because I got the minimum value against his particular hand so if I could replay
this hand knowing that our opponent is flatting with hands like Ace King off suit and presumably hands like suited
Broadways he can certainly have hands like King Queen of Spades King Jack of
Spades King 10 of Spades that would play this way now on the Flop so therefore on
this turn if I could redo this hand I would choose one of two strategies on the turn I would either just bet huge
here just throwing the pocket nines and the adex out the window and just targeting all of his Ace King off his
King Queen of Spades King Jack of Spades King 10 of Spades or I would actually go for a check because if he does have a
hand like pocket NES that hand's going to check back the turn we're only going to get two streets against that hand anyway and then we can just come out and
bet the river and if he does have a hand like King X of Spades here or a hand like Ace King that hand's always going
to bet we can actually go for a check raise for very thin value on this turn and just try to Pile in all the money by
the river against to hand like King Queen of Spades or Ace King or something like that so if I had this information
that our opponent was flatting Str strong hands pre- flop I would take a very different strategy on the turn we can get a lot more greedy with our thick
value all right guys so once again these have been the adjustments I've been making when players are checking their range to me from out of position when
they don't stab when I check to them when they call over bets too wide and when they flat some strong hands pre
flop maybe these aren't the specific adjustments players in your pool are making to you but hopefully this video
gives you some insight in how I think about making counter adjustments and building these plans to start counter
exploiting our opponents hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and it turned you into the biggest boy possible thank
you guys for watching and have a gentle day
