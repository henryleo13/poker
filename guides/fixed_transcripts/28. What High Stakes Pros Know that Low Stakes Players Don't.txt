what separates a low stakes Grinder from a high stakes Crusher today we're going
to find out I'm going to take three poker Pros one who plays low stakes one who plays mid-stakes and one who plays
nose bleed high stakes and we're going to have them play the exact four same hands to get a peek inside their heads
to see just how differently they think about poker first let's meet the players
uh my name is Branson I'm based out of the California LA area I play the 5510
at the gardens which has an 800 cap so it's a bit lower it plays more like a 55 than a 510 right now I'm going the
content creator route so I'd like that Avenue to build but yeah a lot of times I've relied a lot on poker you have the
best shorts man they're so clean and like well executed I can tell you put a ton of time into them I enjoy just being
creative and different I love poker and it's it's fun to have fun and especially in a short format of 60 seconds I'm not
going to go into Crazy Hand analysis so let's just have fun with it I'm Tommy out and I'm from Hong Kong I've played
full-time poker in my car for a year $ 510 in US dollar or exactly is 612 I
heard that you were going to be coming to America in traveling to different
poker cities across the country and making a vlog on the Hungry Horse channel is this true that's true yeah
I'm going to travel to the US and explore different casinos there with Hungry Horse hi guys my name is GTH I am
the co-owner of Hungry Horse poker and I have played as big as $400 $800 $1,600
was in life for this experiment I'm going to walk them through pre-f flop so they all get to the flop in the exact
same way then they will talk us through their thought process post flop for each Street they will have a one minute shot
clock to make their final decision for each hand I have built out contingencies for every scenario that is likely to
occur for example if hero bets less than 500 on the Flop the villain will check raise 3.3x or if hero bets greater than
500 on the Flop villain will check call all right without further Ado let's jump
in all right firstand here so we are playing 2040 and we are 11,000 effective
with the villain who is going to be in the cut off the villain opens to 120 this is a recreational player and we
three bet on the button isolate get the pot heads up against the wreck with King Queen of Spades he is going to call now
the Flop comes Queen Jack 10 with a couple of Hearts our opponent checks it
over to us and this is the first decision point so 1 minute Ready set go
yeah so my first instinct on three bet pots is a lot of times post flop I'm going smaller sizings a lot of times
normally I'm playing less big blinds effective so I'm much shallower than this uh however I will take a larger
sizing if it's going to be a more connected board I'm going to take smaller sizings on dryer boards uh so
here is a pretty heavily connected board and if I'm betting here I'm going to be
betting a little bit bigger I'm not going to be going like you know quarter pot or third pot or something like that I'm going to go a little bit bigger
honestly probably going like 50 to 60% pot so I'd go maybe 450 uh and here with
top pair and an open-ended uh in position I think I'm going to go a little bit more than half pot okay so
450 Final Answer yeah villain check raises to 1,500 here and now you have 1 minute
here walk us through your thoughts Ready set go uh I I already don't love it I I
don't think I'm going to be folding here think I'm going to be re raising here I'm I'm not going to be putting in the three bet so I'm just going to call see
a turn hopefully improve but I'm already starting to feel a little uncomfortable
here so call yep call turn is a deuce of heart he is going to check over to us
here and 1 minute to make your decision Ready set go uh my first instinct is to
check back and see a river I don't think he has a flush here um however he could
be trying to pot control with a number of two pair hands uh say he had Queen Jack 10 Jack something like that mostly
looking to check back here sea River and I'm looking to pot control at this point
even even on the river and I'm not going to be looking to go for a ton of value here so I'm going to check back okay
cool we are going to check so now the river is in offit 3 so a complete blank
and now the villain checks again here and you have one minute Ready Set Go so
again my first instinct is to probably check back here even sitting here with um top hair and the villain is showing
some weakness I think they can still have some strong hands and be scared of the flesh scared of straits and I'm just
trying to think of what I'm going to get value of that uh check raises us on the Flop King Jack or King 10 but I think
it's it's pretty thin I don't know how much I'm really going to get called by that many weaker hands uh so I'm just
going to check back all right here we go one minute countdown yeah uh sillin is a fish and with three bet him pre flop and
then flop comes Queen Jack 10 and the Flop is pretty good for us for this flop I want to see at my entire range that
1/3 here as we are very deep but it's a three by po so the spr is low and this
move to make fish uh to raise his set or even they may have some slow played Ace
King there uh yeah so I'll like to keep his weak range here and then make him
raise his strong range here 8 seconds you got to give me a dollar amount here um 300 300 all right there we go he is
going to check raise to 1,000 now you have 1 minute give me your thoughts
Ready set go so what's fing range here he can have straight a SK that he called
us pref flop and then he can have sets to pair Queen 10 Jack 10 10 jacks or
even Queens can also have nine a suited so he can have the strikes and he can
have the set I can't really think of his bluff here because because as fish their check race is very under Bluff we still
have a sh draw uh yeah so turn may come nine or a and I can re-evaluate by
feelings action so I would like to continue here I would like to call Co all right the turn is a deuce of Hearts
bringing in the front door flush villain is going to check to us after check raising the flap you have 1 minute give
us your thoughts Ready set go okay okay uh feeling checks the turn so I assume
that he got no flush here he will continue Bing the turn with his HK of heart 98 of heart so his range right now
is straight a 89 and those two pass and set here I can check to realize the rer
or I can Bluff with my hands representing the flush uh on this hand because feeling is so kept right now uh
based on his action on turn so I would like to bat here and set up a large bat
on the rer 9.6k behind I would back like 2K here and a part will be
6.8k I'm going to shut the river if there a blank come perfect 2,000 and villain is going to call the river is an
offit 3 villain checks you've got 1 minute give us your thought process on this River Ready set go I'm a bit regret
now on my sizing on the turn I should have B half pot yeah like 1,500 on the the turn and set up a even
bigger size on the reiver 1.5k on the turn that the pot will be
5,800 and we got like 8,000 left yeah so
for now if I have B 2,000 on the turn I am still shuing because I don't think
his straight or SS are going to call but small on the turn like half PO is a
better play so you were shoving the river yep we go all in and he Folds 1 minute at 10 seconds I will give you a
countdown Ready set go all right well this is actually quite a tricky flop texture I think people don't necessarily
always fast play two pair when Ace King is obviously there I would say king queen is probably a two Street hand I
think probably targeting pair plus draw obviously some flush draws maybe hands like Ace Jack 109 stuff like that and
given that most of the range I'm going to be targeting is going to be more in elastic on flop and turn and maybe quite
price sensitive on the river my immediate instinct here would be to pick a flop and turn value sizes rather than
like say flop and River I think really the question is what size gets them to raise with straights and sets well pots
860 maybe 350 400 is going to be my default cat size unless this player is
particularly sticky or I think I'm going 350 on this F 350 he check races to
1150 and now you have 1 minute Ready set go uh I think check raises on
straightening boards where Ace King is there is definitely going to be under bluffed I think this is a texture where they find all of the good hands to raise
and maybe the Bluffs are less obvious I think a lot of the Bluffs are going to be hands that they feel pretty comfortable calling like ax of hearts
and maybe hands like 10 N I think with our equity and this deep potentially
with some bluffing equity and opportunities on future streets I'm pretty uncomfortable bet three betting
this hand cuz I'm really just representing Ace King and again getting fish to fold hands like king9 is not my
favorite so I think I'm going to want more information I think I'm going to proceed with a call recognizing that I'm probably just going to fold on blanks if
I face a barrel I think I'm going to have pretty good bluffing opportunities on certain runouts I think with this
hand at this depth I'm comfortable just calling an evaluating turn planning to Bluff versus some checks and on some
certain runouts going to the turn and it is a deuce of hearts and now he checks 1
minute Ready set go okay range probably going to be straights sets maybe
occasional two pairs since I did pick 350 on the Flop I don't think there's going to be a ton of flushes I think aggressive players who do check raise
flush drawers on this flop this deep are going to continue with a bet again on the turn so I'm expecting their range to
be a lot of two pair sets and straights I'm going to think about turning this hand into a bluff this deep I think if I
was shallow I'd probably just try and realize My Equity with my open Ender and probably check back but I think at this
dep I'm pretty interested in turning this hand into a bluff cuz I don't think I have really any Showdown value so I'm
trying to think about sculpting spr the nice thing about being this deep in this bigger game is I probably don't need a
giant River spr I think something around pot on the river maybe even slightly less given out the dollar figure I'm
think I'm probably going around 2500 on this turn with the intention of bluffing
everything but a non-pairing river I think I'm going about 2600 all right that was right down to the wire 2.6k
this River it is a three and you have one minute Ready set go what is their
range well I don't think many of The Straits and sets and two pair are folding on the turn my intention was to
get them to the river with that range I've set up an spr that I would be uncomfortable at in a smaller game I
think in a bigger game dollars just speak more than big blinds don't really think I have any Showdown value I had a
plan on the turn happily this River isn't really changing anything I think
again I would just test my working since I've got extra time I'm very confident that my plan was to shove think I've
managed spr okay maybe I'd like a little bit more back perhaps I've got a little bit greedy with the get them to call
twice and fold in the biggest po but I think the dollar amount here is enough I think particularly on a board that Ace
King is so obviously there don't really see any other viable options I don't think a small bet achieves anything
don't think checking back I think I'm just putting the money in and hoping that I can get a tank fault all right next hand here playing 2040 once again
we are 6,000 effective this time we're going to open on the button to $120 with ace8 offit a fish in the small blind is
going to call and a nitty Pro kind of a tight trying player who's definitely more on the conservative side is going
to come along in the big blind as well so three ways to a flop Ace Queen n and it checks over to us on the Flop we've
got top pair 1 minute to make our decision here on the Flop Ready set go
here having top pair for me on three-way hands or more if there's multi way I I
play pretty face up I typically don't do a lot of airball bluffing uh with top
pair I don't love my Kicker here with an8 but I think I can still bet I'm
probably not going to go too big in a multi-way pot might go like 120 150 here
I'll go with 150 here cool now the small blind folds and the big blind calls and now the pot is 660 going to the turn
it's a three of Hearts bringing up backdoor heart draws so we are heads up and now the big blind checks one minute
Ready set go so after I make the bet on the Flop and then get called uh I think
the villain could have a number of draws here and Ace themselves depends on how
aggressive they are too with the number of their Aces if they're someone who three bats all the time with Ace Jack
Ace Queen 55 a lot of times that they don't even do that here in the 240 they should be so our Ace is decent here uh I
think I'm going to check back though still Bluff catch if they decide to lead a lot of rivers it it depends on the
river Okay cool so we are going to check back now the river is an offit king and
the big blind checks once again one minute Ready set go off suit King uh
looking to get value I mean the only thing I'm really going to be getting value from probably some Queen X hands
and only if I go super small to be honest I really don't mind a check back here just because I don't think I'm
going to be getting called by much worse I guess a worse Ace is possible like a a 5 A6 A7 something like that A4 I'm
probably just going to check here or bet super small but I'll probably just check final decision 5 Seconds yeah check check okay cool 1 minute on this flap
Ready set go so I think for the small blind and big blind they the range at
like uh C connectors or uh Broadway offert Ander pocket pass and that's a
range I don't think my hand has a three stet value I would check this flop
because my Kicker is not that good I could also B to charge the flush draw I'm fine with checking here because
sometimes the fish on a small blind or the trying rack on the back blind they can have flat as some ACE Jack Ace 10
yeah so I want to see their action on the turn before I do my batting we are
going to check going to the turn which is a three of Hearts the small blind checks big blind bets
250 you have 1 minute Ready Set go so for the small blind I don't think
interested in the PO H because it checks so he doesn't have something like Ace or strong combo drawers for the big blind
he BS like two third Parts it uh is a big bet as we check the Flop we gave
them rope he could be batting with a some combo draw like a jack 10 should it
Jack 10 of diamond and Jack 10 of hard 54 of diamond five4 of heart those hands
so uh since I've checked the flops I would like to call and if valer the river so we call in small blindfolds the
river is a offit king the big blind is
going to check you have one minute Ready set go I don't think he get something
like T Jack now because T Jack is a straight now so he doesn't have a
straight now I like to fell about targeting his King 10 combo draw on turn
that his a king on the river and some ACE yeah and some top pair so batting
large here doesn't achieve that so I would like to bet like 250 to 300 yeah
targeting his top pair weight kicker or give me the exact size King 300 300 300
yeah perfect 1 minute Ready set go well my default on these a high boards is
going to be quite a lot of like big b or check don't think our hand really falls into that I think this is a board way
like with the flush drawer and the queen of the nine there's just like quite a lot of middle pair bottom pair drawers
that I can Target with a smaller size I might deviate away from my big battle
check strategy here particularly with a fish in the small blind who's probably going to be pretty sticky and I suspect
that the big blind's going to play pretty straightforward I'm pretty tempted to just pick a small size here I
think what's the parts like 360 might have gone even slightly bigger pre I I think I'm probably looking at
like 125 to 150 just targeting like weer asex some flush draws some gut shots
some straight draws Queen X yeah I think my final answer is like 125 on the Flop seems pretty reasonable on this texture
versus two weaker players all right so go 125 which is quite annoying in a $10
uh chip sorry sorry uh 125 small blindfolds big blind calls and we are
going to a turn which is a three of hearts and the big blind checks over to us you have one minute Ready set go okay
and what's my opponent's range pots around 600 I think they probably have pretty much all the weaker ax ton of
draws ton of pair plus drawers question is what do I want to Target well those drawers feel very inelastic I think if
they do have a hand like Queen x with a flush draw or ASX of diamonds I think
I'm probably going to Target that with a pretty big size it feels thin I may
barely cut myself occasionally what's the biggest size that they call with draws here I was trying to make Queen X
I'd probably be in about the 2x part I think I can probably bet 1,200 here with
the intention of checking back a lot of draw completing Rivers yeah I think I'm going to bet really large here with the
intention of checking back I'm going to go 1200 so we go 1.2k and the river is
an offit King he checks one minute on the river Ready set go all right range
is a bunch of asex that I chop with I think maybe one or two maybe Ace 10 off that I lose to maybe a couple of
straights with hands like Jack 10 I think trying r or wck might three bet occasionally with that lot of one pair
King X which a flush draw Queen X 9x M draws with a pair pots like 3ish K what
happens if I bet really small doesn't sound like the player I'm inducing against can I be aide that fold and
chops that feels pretty interesting to me I think if they tank hold the turn I
think they have more ASX than I'd be more incentivized to Bluff the river to fold out chops if they quickly called
the turn I'm leaning towards probably checking back pretty interesting to bet
like 3 or 400 think against a fish I would do that against the tri I'm probably just checking back all right
all right next hand here plane 2040 once again we've got JJ Rex in the cuto we open to 120 villain in this hand is
going to be an aggressive recreational player in the small blind he three bets to 500 and just a couple notes on this
player he is a thinking player he is capable he is not a pro but he is quite
aggressive especially if you give him rope he will put in a lot of money as a
bluff and for Value one other note on this player is he is just kind of playing the seven Deuce game even though
the table is not playing the seven Deuce game he loves to Bluff with seven Deuce have seen him just three bet with seven
Deuce off quite a bit just because he thinks it's funny to show the bluff so he can have some seven dece when he
three bets we are going to call here with pocket Jack going to a flop which is 1093 and now the aggressive villain
bets $375 one minute to make your decision Ready set go after the small blind bets
I think either calling or raising are things that I'm both thinking about clearly we're not folding against
somebody who is going to to be blasting someone who could be having seven deuce and bluffing quite a bit I'm just going
to call here the turn is an eight and it brings backd door Hearts he comes out and checks you have one minute Ready set
go checking on the turn H trying to think what he's doing when he's checking the turn here it's tough when we're so
deep like this if we bet and get raised and then face a barrel on the river doesn't feel great I am between things I
am I'm going to go for a bet I'm going to bet about half pot I'm going to bet uh 900 cool Final Answer yeah so we bet
900 and villain folds you got one minute give us your thoughts Ready set go so
it's range now he got uh overpar of course and he can also have 10 and nines
sets and also he can have two overcard and for the size is 1/3 it doesn't
really represent anything it can be M hand it can be Blu for our hand I think
raising does it no good so I will be calling we are going to call and the
turn eight of Hearts he checks to us give us your thoughts on this turn Ready
set go mhm we have the best 10 here I
think most of the time but also uh a good player they would have checked their overp pass here on turn the eight
complete a lot of strikes of us but we we got Jack we have the best blockers here I can check and I can bats here I
don't really think I need to Bluff with my hand here but I want to deny some high card Equity here so I would bat
like half put yeah 900 all right so you're 900 Final Answer yep all right so
we bet 900 and vfold one minute go I think his range is
probably pretty wide if you're going to include 16 combos of seven Deuce I have
a good knowledge of Poker when there aren't weird side games that maybe he's
playing or that the table is playing like my thought process is well drilled when I have a really good sense of like
hey a fish plays like this an aggressive fish plays like this I think in this spot here if he does have a bunch of
hands like seven Deuce raising doesn't make a lot of sense because I kind of want to let him have some rope and Blast
Off Jax is yeah slightly vulnerable against some of his two overcard hands but also this depth feels a little bit
ambitious to try and put all the money in against an aggressive player I tend to just give them rout I think honestly
I'd keep it pretty simple just call evaluate turn and the turn is an eight bringing back door hearts and now he
checks ready set go I think when fish check on the turn here they just have a
cap range I don't think they protect checking ranges here I think greed drives a lot of their decisions aggressive players when they have big
hands want to get paid I think this check signals a lot of weakness against a weak range I think we have the best
hand almost always and against aggressive players I'm looking to give them opportunity to make mistakes and I
think the play that gets probably the biggest mistake is a size that looks weak and I think that that would be
probably something around oneir part giving him an opportunity if he does have a hand like king queen or seven
Deuce right to potentially put in a big race to try and blow us off what perceived to be a weak hand I think
something around 5600 really just the red rag to a bull and at this depth here my intention
would be to bet Cole I think think I probably plump in for a size yeah let's say 600 he check races to
25,000 and 1 minute here Ready set go well we've got our check phas again it's
important to continually re-evaluate we thought his range was weak when he checked turn I think that obviously turn
check raises from most recreational players are under bluffed I think here just a lot of good hands would just keep
betting themselves and therefore I am skeptical about this range being
particularly strong that kind of rules out bet three betting just given one I don't think I am actually ahead of his
Valley range and I think that that just immediately lets him off the hook with a bluff it's going to be a little bit stressful on a number of different
Rivers but I think at this depth here I have to trust my read I have to call the nice thing about being in position I'm
going to get additional information on the river information equals Edge I think I'm just calling here do my best
to put him on a bunch of Bluffs I'm not going to get too specific because again I don't know where he's pulling those
from I think I'm just calling and evaluating River now the river is a six bringing a oneliner to a seven in case
you can't see straights like me you know me now he bets 7,000 into 6790 and 1
minute it is on us Ready set go uh well this adds a fun little wrinkle uh I
would say I'm immediately into my bluff catching checklist which is what is their range well we thought there was a
number of Bluffs well some of those Bluffs have got there but I think a lot of the value hands on the turn that we
would have expected a check graay from don't love this card so I think he's either got there on the river or was
bluffing the question is is he over or under bluffing that's really where the money is if I can recognize as a spot
that is over bluffed I have an easy call with any Bluff catcher if I think he's under bluffing think then obviously this
is going to be an easy fold I don't think raising is going to make a ton of sense with this amount of Stack depth
behind I think we really have only two options in front of us I think a lot of the time people do just keep battling
with seven High I think this is someone who saw weakness on the turn and went for it I think I am putting the money in
here with the phrase show me something good and we call and he shows a screen huzzah all right last hand here we are
playing 1020 an open king queen offit on the button to $60 a fish in the small
blind calls and the main villain in the hand is going to be an old man coffee here in the big blind he is going to
call as well couple notes on this player is very tight does not put money in unless he has it is capable of folding
uh some relatively strong hands though but this guy has not put money in as a bluff since
1964 so he is going to call three ways to a flop which comes king queen 7 so we flop top two it checks over to us on the
button and first decision Point here you have 1 minute to make your decision Ready set go so for me there are kind of
multiple things at play here again again because we're multi-way i t typically will go smaller however this board
there's going to be a lot of draws like 10 Jack Hearts um number of gut shots so
I am going to size up a little bit so size down a little bit because it's multi-way uh and then size up a little
bit because the board is connected here there's a lot of Jaws so I'm going to go uh about half pot I'm going to go uh 90
or exactly half pot you go 90 and both players call the turn now is a deuce of
Hearts bringing in the front door flush and now the small blind and big blind both check to us again 1 minute Ready
set go I really don't like when main draws come in when I get called uh in
multiple spots by people my first instinct is is to check back here um and
evaluate a river where we either call possibly fold or see what happens yeah so I I believe I'm going to be checking
here the thing is sometimes small blind or big blind would lead however with one street to come they're they're not
guaranteed to lead here with their fleshes so um I'm just going to check back perfect now the river is an offit
two and both players check to us again here on this River one minute Ready set
go two on the river pairs the board I I don't expect that either player has a
two here now I am thinking I can get value against a king um I'm trying to
think how big I want to go my instinct to not go super big to get value from
just a king who just is a little bit stubborn um so I'm probably going to go like a third pot like 150 here 150 small
blind folds and the big blind check raises 550 and now it is back to US 1 minute
Ready set go so getting check raised on the river doesn't feel good um it really
is going to be player dependent uh against some people I would call against some people I would fold against an old
man I've been guilty of this betting with a set when someone has a straight and gets raised and I just know he has
the straight and I get canned because of it uh I've I've been uh I've been on both ends where I've folded this kind of
hand and been right also been wrong called where I've been mostly wrong I
don't know 10 seconds against the old man I'm just going to fold you have 1 minute Ready set go uh we hit a we got a
pretty good flop a lot of six draw out there but we also blocked top pair and
the second pair so I would like to B how pot here keeping all those flush draws
pass 7x Queen X KX here if I'm betting like two3 I think queens and Sevens
Queens may not be folding but sevens are definitely folding so I'll bet 100 with my head we are going to bet 100 and both
players call turn and it's a two of Hearts bringing in the front door flush and both players check it over to US 1
minute Ready set go yeah flush came on on the turn so uh for the OMC I don't
think he is leading with his flush show so the small blind and the big blind
they can both possibly have flush and so for more information I would check this
turn to evaluate the river by their sizing on the river as you mentioned the
big blind is a native player uh who will put a lot of money when he got a big big
hand so maybe when he BS more I can call with my hand but when it that big I can
fold the river is an offsuit deuce and the small blind checks and the big blind checks and it is on us here on this
River 1 minute Ready set go H now I would like to fa a little B here
targeting Queen X that makes a two pair as well in the mind but I can't do so
big since the flush out there they they may be afraid of the flush there so I'll
go I'll go 400 yeah TI and King X and queen X non-believing Queen X so we are
going to go 400 small blind folds big blind check raises 1,00 here you have 1
minute Ready set go first his range I don't think he got set there he can only
have sevens on the floor but since he didn't check R so I don't think he have set so he can't have Full House Full
House on this board so yeah he has flush here uh so the question is are we dip
enough to Bluff here will he fold when we shove I think for an OMC he would
probably fold his flush and checking the set makes a lot of sense on the turn for us yeah so I'll turn my two pair into a
bluff and I'll go all in 1 minute Ready set go two weak players in the blinds I
I am sizing up on a lot of King High boards I think it's pretty hard to get people to call with with weaker pairs I
think those flush draws are in elastic I think King X is in elastic I think Jack 10 is in elastic my instinct on a board
like this would be to size up probably somewhere in the $120 to $150 range we
pretty deep for 1020 here with two players I think I'd probably just be betting 120 not worrying about having
them fold pocket Pairs and 7x just trying to go for gold against the open Enders flush drawers King portion of
range I think Queen X probably sticks around for 120 I just bet 120 here and keep it simple so we go 120 both players
call going to a turn two of hearts and now it checks to US 1 minute Ready set
go not my favorite especially against two players ranges uh obviously there can be plenty of King X and some draws
but obviously the big blind once he overalls if he really is the OMC of om
C's is going to probably have a range that looks like King X and flush draws
and obviously we beat the kingx but are we getting three streets is the question
now against most players I would say yes but against your 75-year-old OMC perhaps
we have a two Street hand and when I have two streets hands I want to get as much clarity about their range and playing in position if I check back a
huge River bet from him it's just a flush and I have a very easy fault and if they check the river to me I have a
lot of clarity I can go for Value I think this feels close to me between betting myself and checking back I think
with this profile I think a check works pretty well so we check River it's a deuce now they both check again here 1
minute Ready set go pretty good River obviously now they don't have quote unquote kicker problems with their kingx
portion of range I think I have a very clear value bet here targeting kingx I think the number of flushes in range has
been significantly diminished in this spot here the question is is what size
does King X call here there really are two options here I think we could get a
little bit greedier with something maybe around 350 400 but with the flush draw
coming in really the question is what size would I bet to make king9 fold probably multi-way here with uh just a
little bit more fold Equity probably something like 400 maybe if I'm trying to capture value from every King X from
an OMC and a fish probably something about 250 feels like a pretty good size
for me on the River where I think King X just flicks in the call 250 yeah small blind folds big blind 875 on US 1 minute
Ready set go well obviously he's finding a ton of Bluffs omcs are known for check
Rays bluffing the river at high frequencies I think this is a player who has got rather proudly uh trapped us
with his flushes I think it's pretty hard to have many boats in this spot here so the question is is do I want to
fold against someone who is under bluffing with my bluff catcher or do I have a second option what happens if I
bet three bet here the question I would ask myself if I was here with however I
got here with Queens would I against a flush put all the money in for value and
I think the answer is a pretty clear no I think MC's Pride themselves on being able to fold anything but the nuts and
we block a lot of the nuts with king queen I think this is a spot where my
preferences would be call is the worst then fold I think I like a bet three bet all in here to maximize fold Equity
against the flush all in all right so conclusions here Branson our lowex Pro he played solid he didn't really make
any big blunders he found a positive EV line in pretty much every hand he just
maybe didn't always find the highest EV line Tommy our midsts Pro found a couple
of the more creative lines found a higher EV line than Branson in a couple of of the hands but didn't find the
highest EV line in every hand and finally gethin our high stakes Pro found pretty much the most creative highest EV
line in every single hand in the first hand here after calling the Flop check rise Branson just kind of took his
Showdown value here on the turn and river and checked back did not find the creative line where we kind of turn this
one into a bluff because really once his flushing card comes in on the turn after villain check raises the Flop and then checks the turn we just don't really
have much Showdown value even though we have top pair here so Branson just took his Showdown value checked back the turn
and checked back the river whereas Tommy on this turn elected to start turning his hand into a bluff right away chose a
relatively big size to get called by two pair sets and Straits he left himself behind that big chunky overb on the
river and got the fold here from two pair gin played the same line as Tommy but chose a slightly bigger size on the
Flop just realizing on this wet Dynamic board villains will Fast play even to a slightly bigger size so he went a little
bit bigger on the Flop villain check r a little bit bigger gethin called and now here on the turn when villain checked gethin chose an even bigger size 2600
versus Tommy's 2000 just realizing that because the absolute dollar amount is so big he didn't necessarily need to leave
himself a big boy overb behind on the river because 6800 is a lot of dollars
and absolute dollar size starts to matter more than the relative size of the pot so on top of finding the bluff
like Tommy did here Gan found a slightly bigger size on the Flop and a slightly bigger size on the turn so gin actually
got more money in the pot before he made the villain fold all right on this second hand here Branson seet on the
Flop and then on the turn and River he just checked back he ended up chopping with Ace five of diamonds here so he got
in one street of value where he was ahead Tommy took a little bit of a different line he actually elected to
check back this flop here he called on the turn and then on the river which was
a king Tommy correctly deduced that top pair is pretty much always going to be good here that villain would just always
come out and bet two pair or a set or a straight on the river so Tommy actually went for thin value on the river and
although he ended up chopping the pot Tommy a lot of the times would get two streets in this spot instead of one
finally GTH here also went for value on the Flop just like Branson and he got called and then on this turn which
brought in quite a lot of draws GTH deduced that his opponent is just going to have a lot of hands that are in
elastic here acex of diamonds Queen X of Hearts 9x of Hearts combo draw Etc so
just lots of hands here that his opponent is just not folding so gin went super thin on this turn and actually 2x
potted this turn with top pair weak kicker got called by worse and then on the river it went check check of course
he Chopped with a five of diamonds as well here Gan found a bunch of extra EV in this hand that our low stakes and
mid-stakes Pros did not in this pocket Jack's hand both Branson and Tommy played the same way they called The Flop
here and then when it checked to them on the turn both of them used a half pot size which is starting to be a pretty
big size for the game $900 here and I had written in the contingencies here that if we bet greater than $800 on the
turn that villain will just fold that he won't start turning ridiculous hands into a bluff here because we don't give
him rope if we take a big size on the turn whereas gethin our high stakes Pro correctly deduced here on the turn that
our opponent had a weak range after betting the Flop small and then checking the turn and if he bets small he could
either entice our aggressive wreck opponent to float with overcards or even better spaz and start turning some hands
into Bluffs so gin chose a very small size here oneir pot here on the turn to induce and the villain ended up check
raising and then over bet bluffing on the river Gan snapped it off and our opponent had Ace Queen offit finally in
this king queen hand with top two pair Branson went for value on the Flop check back the turn when the flush came in
then when it checked to him on the river he chose a small size here for Value just targeting King X and when the OMC
raised he found a fold here which is very reasonable Tommy and gethin both got to the river in the same way as
Branson but when they bet the river and got raised here they just deduced that the OMC villain here would just almost
never have a boat and they bet on the fact that they could make this guy fold a king high or Ace High flush draw for
all of the money they could incredibly rep a hand like pocket kings pocket Queens pocket sevens here that would
play this way all of the time so they elected to turn their hand into a bluff to get the villain to to fold the ace
high and King High flushes all right guys hopefully this video was Illuminating getting inside the head and seeing the thought process of a low
stakes mid-stakes and high stakes Pro hopefully this video helped you level up your game and turn into the biggest boy
possible thank you guys and have a gentle day
