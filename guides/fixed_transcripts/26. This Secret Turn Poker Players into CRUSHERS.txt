there is one skill that every poker Crusher has that losing or break even players do not it's not being able to
read people or knowledge of theory or even work ethic no these are all good things but it's much simpler so I'm
going to explain what this skill is then I'm going to show how you can develop it by asking just two simple questions
during hands you don't need software you don't need a solver you don't need a fancy subscription none of that no you
just need your brain ready let's jump in first let's take two players on one side
we have a novice player and when he plays a hand he thinks betting is good because I get to win this pot a lot so
he bets on the other side we have a Crusher and when he plays a hand he thinks a little bit differently he's thinking well if I bet X happens and if
I check y happens then on the turn Z happens therefore y might be better than
x can you see the difference the novice player comes to a conclusion then gives himself evidence the conclusion is good
he thinks one step ahead the crusher on the other hand is able to weigh several
options and plan multiple moves ahead this is the skill chess not Checkers all
right let me show you how to do this so let's look at a hand and we're playing 25 and we open it up on the button with 10 n of Spades to $25 and the big blind
a recreational player is going to call in the Flop Here Comes A7 Deuce rainbow
and I had a recent video where I was talking about I don't see bet my range this is the one board where I don't really see B my range and a comment
popped up and this comment actually inspired the whole video and the comment said something to the effect of of A7 Deuce rainbow if the opponent will fold
hands like pocket 3es and King Jack suited versus a small bet you are absolutely printing with a range bet
here zero sense to develop a checking range in position with such range advantage and such an
overfolded or pocket 3s which is pretty good for us but before we just come to an answer and then just start trying to
support our answer like the novice player here in our example let's ask two
questions and asking just two questions allows us to build the skill build the Reps to be much more like the crusher so
what are the two questions we should be asking in every hand very very simple what is their range and what happens if
so let's go back to our hand now and the first question we will ask is what is their range so we opened on the button
our opponent defended from the big blind this is going to be a recreational player they're defending wide so they have a wide range maybe something like
this defending something like 40% of hands from the big blind we have not really narrowed down their range yet
except they probably don't have the bottom of the range right they don't have stuff like 10 do soft suit or nine do sof suit because of stuff would
mostly fold pre-f flop and they don't have the absolute top of the range right you see they don't have Aces they don't really have Kings this stuff with three
bet pre-f flop right so we can eliminate some of the top we can eliminate some of the bottom but overall they have a wide range all right step one complete we've
got the range now we ask what happens if first what happens if we seat Well if we
seat here he's going to fold out a lot of weak stuff which is okay for us right we fold out hands that are better we
fold out hands like pocket fours pocket threes king queen king Jack we fold this stuff quite a bit which is pretty good
for us so let's start building a little flowchart here what happens if we see bet well he's going to fold a lot the
next scenario here could be if we see bet and he check raises well we just have 10 high he probably has a strong hand on this board if he check raises so
we would just fold we don't really have anything going on so pretty easy so far but what happens if he calls here well
if he calls here we're going to get to the turn we have 10 high we don't really have any Showdown value so let's just
play out this scenario well we could keep barreling on the turn and we could choose a big size but the problem with
this size is because this board is so static and dry on the flap he may have some traps he may have some hands like
pocket sevens pocket Deuces A7 that just trap on this flop so by betting big on this turn we're going to fold out his 7x
his Dux Etc and we're going to get in a lot of money against his single pair ASX that may fold the river but the problem
is when we overb on this turn and he calls well he's just going to have a very very strong range because he may
just slow play on the flop because the board is so static and dry and then we overb on the turn which when we bet big
our opponents are much less likely to fast play their strong hands much more likely to call so getting to this River he may have a lot of hands like pocket
sevens pocket Deuces A7 ace deuce Ace Queen ace6 right he just has a lot of
two pair sets Etc getting to this River so if we bet big on this River after over betting the turn we're just going
to get snapped off by a very strong portion of his range and if we bet small on this River if we don't go all in well
we're just getting called by hands like Ace Jack Ace 10 Ace 9 Etc so when we bet big on the turn well we don't really
have any good options on this River okay what if we bet small on the turn here we bet small on the turn to incentivize him
to start raising his two pair A7 ace deuce pocket sevens pocket Deuces Etc so we go small on the turn we go half pot
now the problem is getting to the river the pot is going to be relatively small he's going to have a lot of hands like
7x of clubs do sex of clubs he's going to have some weak stuff on the river but he's also going to have still some
strong hands that wouldn't raise the turn hands like Ace King Ace Queen that's now two pair even hands like Ace
Jack and Ace 10 so what size do we bet on this River well if we go big on this River we just get snapped off by Ace
Queen Ace King Etc so going big probably not great if we go medium on this River
well we're probably just getting called by Ace Jack and Ace 10 and that type of stuff that isn't going to fold to a
triple barrel when we go small on the turn and medium on the river if we go small on the river I guess that could be
an option here maybe we just want to fold like SX of clubs or Dux of Clubs but that's really not a big part of his
range so again betting small on the turn after C betting the Flop doesn't seem to be a great option all right what happens
if we check back this turn after seab betting the Flop well now getting to the river if he checks they're just going to
check a lot of hands like Ace three ace4 ace8 whatever and because they don't float with the weak stuff on the Flop
most of the range getting to this river is going to be acex and if we check back the turn we're just really not going to
have any fold Equity against ax even if we choose a big size here on this River so I guess again we could just go small
on this River to try to fold hands like 7x of clubs or Dex of clubs but we're going to lose two streets here against
ax quite a bit the other problem with checking back this turn is sometimes the villain will just come out and bet the river himself and we have 10 high so we
just see bet on the Flop and then we have to fold the river so we just see bet and then I guess we give up and we
lose which again doesn't seem like an amazing option all right so here's our summary what happens if we see bet all
right sometimes he folds which is an instant print for us right he folds out better just like the YouTube commenters said this is this is pretty good for us
right we fold King Jack suited we fold pocket 3es sometimes he raises which we just fold 109 suited no big deal the
problem is when we see bet and he calls we can't really Define his range because this board is so static and dry they
won't call with their weak stuff and raise their strong stuff so we don't really have a profitable second Barrel
on turns no matter if we go big no matter if we go small no matter if we check and try to Bluff we just don't really have a profitable decision after
C betting the Flop if they call all right so let's consider another option here what happens if we check back on
the Flop well if we check back one of three things is going to happen our opponent is either going to check the turn he's going to bet small on the turn
or he's going to bet big on the turn all right so let's go through these three permutations and figure out what happens
if all right first let's jump into what happens when we check back the Flop and now our opponent checks on the turn so
what is our opponent's range when they check here on the turn and this is why considering Alternatives can be so good
because live recreational opponents are going to tell you a lot about their hand strength here going to the turn when
they check on the turn it probably means their range is going to be quite weak right because when they do have strong
ASX when they do have sets when they do have top pair once we check back on the Flop they just come out and bet on the
turn quite a bit so when they check you're on the turn their range is primarily going to be Showdown value hands like pocket 3's hands like 7x
hands like pocket 8s it's going to be some air hands just like Jack 10 high king queen High whatever and it's also
going to be some draws maybe that they just don't feel comfortable stabbing Maybe some straight draws like 54 89
maybe some flush draws Etc but overall if they check the turn their range is going to be weak so now by checking back
on the flap we have a little bit more information about our opponent's range that we wouldn't have if we see bet on
this particular board so now we know our opponent probably has a weaker range than they're supposed to have at
equilibrium so now we can just double barrel very big we can choose a big size here on the turn because our opponent's
going to be in elastic with some of their draws to check if they do have a hand like 7x or pocket 8s they're probably calling once even if we choose
a big size here on the turn now we go to the river and we know here on the river with a pretty decent degree of certainty
that our opponents aren't going to have sets they're not going to have two pair they're not going to have a hand like Ace queen that would just come out and
bet on the turn a lot sure every once in a while they can just have a weak acex hand a hand like Ace 3 Ace 4 ace5 Etc
but most of the range is going to be even weaker than that we can't really run into any brick walls here we can't really run into two pair sets Etc
because those hands would just come out and bet the turn or check raise the turn so we can just blast here on on the river we can go something like 3x pot
even get them to fold their hands like Ace 3 ace4 Ace 5 which we couldn't do on Rivers if we see bet the flop because
that did not allow us to Define our opponent's range all right so we see here when our opponent checks the turn once again the range is going to be
showd on value and air so we just get to double barrel and win a lot what if our opponent bets small on the turn all
right so once again we are going to check back on this flop now the turn six of clubs again and our opponent comes out and Bets half pot or slightly less
than half pot here on the turn first of all we always want to ask what is our opponent's range well when they bet in the turn the board is starting to get a
little bit more draw heavy there's a flush draw out there there's several straight draws out there so usually usually usually usually this has been
pretty reliable for me at live low stakes poker when our opponent comes out and Bets small less than half pot on the
turn after we check back the Flop it's usually once again going to be a weaker range now there's going to be some ax in here there's going to be some hands like
Ace 10 ace9 Ace 8 Etc but it's usually not going to be two pair it's not going to be sets and it's not going to be
super strong ax like Ace King or Ace queen or Ace Jack or whatever it's going to be weaker one pair hands some draws
some Showdown value some Bluffs Etc it's going to be a weaker range so what this allows us to do on the turn is
essentially float with our entire range here even with 10 high with a gut shot here we can float on this turn and then
our opponent comes out on the river and they bet half pot again now they are just screaming our opponent has told us twice in no uncertain terms excuse me
sir I do not have a strong hand so at this point we can just lay the hammer down we can raise here on this River
because now we further defined our opponent's range and also what does our hand look like to our opponent right
right how would fish play pocket aces or pocket sevens if they were in position well they usually like to trap
especially on dry static boards so our hand looks like to a fish it looks like a hand like pocket aces pocket sevens
pocket Deuces pocket Queens something like that they just woke up on the river here with a big hand and since our
opponent has told us two times they do not have a strong hand floating the turn and then raising the river if they bet
small again floating the turn and then raising the river allows us to win two bets against the weaker portion of the
range where if we just see bet on the Flop a lot of the stuff would fall and yes we would win the pot we would win zero against the portion of the range
that sometimes just comes out and monkey bets the turn small and then monkey bets the river again and we just always get to take it away the other scenario here
after checking back the Flop is they bet the turn small we're going to float our range again now on the river they are going to check to us well pretty similar
situation here than when they bet the river small they've told us on the turn they have a weak range by betting small and now they follow that up by checking
on the river the best hands are going to have here is like a single pair acex like an ace3 and ace5 and again they're
just not going to have two pair they're not going to have sets they're not going to have strong hands when they take this line so we can just put in the big boy
Hammer bet here on this River we're going to need to go very very big because we're only telling them once that we have a strong hand so I like to
use a 3.5 4X even 5x overb here on this River try to get them to fold their weak
ASX and we don't really need to be efficient with our Bluff size here because we're just never really concerned about running into a strong
hand all right so we see here summary when our opponent bets small in the turn their range once again going to be pretty weak it's going to be weak ASX
Showdown value some draws some some air so we just get to float and we get to Bluff the river quite a bit whether they
check the river we can Bluff or if they bet the river small or medium themselves and we can just Bluff raise the river if
we don't get there finally what happens if we check back the Flop and our opponent just comes out and Bets big on
the turn we have a pretty easy decision now because our opponents tend to Telegraph their hand strength with their
bet size and when they come out and bet big on the turn what is their range well it's probably going to be strong acex some two pair some sets maybe a straight
it's just going to be a very very strong wrong range here and you see I conveniently changed the card so we didn't have a gut shot here to make our
decision to make our life a little bit easier but generally if our opponent just comes out and Bets big on the turn we're not going to be bluffing this
range on the river even if they check we're not going to be floating with our entire range on the turn our opponent just makes our life easier they Define
their range for us when we check back and we just have a very very easy fold here so we see here in summary once
again what happens if we check a lot of good things happen when our opponent has a weak range we just get to win and when our opponent has a strong range we just
get let off the hook quite a bit and we see here going back to our comparison of
the novice player versus the crusher the novice player comes to a decision if I see bet I get to win it is good the
crusher simply asks the question what happens if and plays out all the permutations there's a famous chess quote when you see a good move look for
a better one gin you like chess
right all right next hand here and this is one of my favorite examples to use so let's jump into it a recreational player
going to open on the button we're going to defend in the big blind with 7 six of diamonds swp comes 983 we check and our
opponent checks back so we go to a turn which is an Ace and now most novice
players in this spot are going to come out on this turn and think well you know I don't have Showdown value let's just
come out and bet on the turn because if I bet I just get to fold out a lot of hands like King high or Jack high or
pocket fours or whatever which is really really good for us when we have seven High yes that is true but let's go
through and ask these two big picture questions so first what is the range well I think we can split the range into
three pretty distinct categories here on this turn one they're going to have a lot of Ace X these hands Ace King Ace
Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 these hands make a lot of sense to check back on the flop because they have Showdown value so they have a lot of top pair they also have a
lot of just like big Broadway cards that didn't connect with this flop maybe king queen suited King jack off hands like
that just big Broadway cards that didn't connect didn't really feel comfortable betting on kind of a wet dynamic IC board and then finally they're going to
have some under pairs they're going to have some hands like pocket fours pocket fives pocket sixes maybe even some 8X or
stuff like that that checked back here on the Flop so it's going to be top pair it's going to be just some King high or queen High type Broadway cards and it's
going to be some Showdown value like 8X or under pairs so now what happens if if we come out and just bet on this turn we
get the under pairs to fold which is good we can get the adex to fold which is good we get their King highs to fold
which is pretty good again but when we get called now we are in quite fight the pickle because going to the river once
they call on the turn their range is going to be a lot of acex so we could check on this River when we miss and we just lost one street against their top
pair which is okay but not ideal or we could Bluff on this River and even if we overb on this River a lot of the times
our opponent is just going to get there with Ace King or Ace Queen and snap us off so neither option seems ideal now
let's consider what happens if we check this turn well if we check it over to our opponent what are they going to do
mostly they're going to bet when they have hands like Ace King Ace Queen Ace those hands are going to put in a bet
and also when they have these Broadway cards like King jack off or king queen or whatever those hands will often see
this card is a good card to stab or barrel and they will put in kind of a stab or a bluff here when we check it
over to them as well so a lot of the range is just going to bet and then what we can do once they bet here now we can
go for the big boy check raise and what this check raise does is number one we just got a bet from their Broadway cards
where if we just bet ourselves those hands would fold the other nice thing here is that we are telling Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack we are telling all these
hands in no uncertain terms you are no good these hands are no good by taking a check raise line we are maximizing fold
Equity check raising maximizes fold Equity just coming out embedding ourselves minimizes fold Equity check raising looks so much stronger allows us
to build up the pot it's how Live players generally play their value so we just look very very strong here and even
if our opponent calls on the turn we've now got a 2X pot Big Boy Bluff behind on the river we can just put all the money
in and get our opponent to to fold hands like Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack because we've told them twice that we have a
hand that beats those hands and in general when you take this huge check raise and then Jam the river our opponent is probably going to fold most
of their single pair ax now occasionally occasionally we do run into some hands like ace3 or Ace 8 that checked back
middle or bottom pair on the Flop and made two pair on the turn so occasionally we will run into a brick wall here but I would say the majority
of the time we are going to get the fold either on the turn or on the river which is even better for us and remember there
were three parts of our opponent's range when we check it over to them on the turn the ASX which we think is going to stab some of these King High Queen High
Broadway cards that we think are going to stab and then finally our opponent's also going to have like The Showdown
value portion of the range the pocket fours the pocket sixes whatever these hands will probably check back that's
okay because if they do check back now we can just come out and over bet the river we know that our opponent probably
doesn't have an ASX hand those hands would just come out and bet the turn at a high frequency they're just going to have a lot of hands like pocket fivs
pocket fours 8 whatever what does our hand look like when we come out with a huge overb on this River well looks like
we have ASX it looks like we have two pair we're still telling a credible story because you know we could have been going for the check raise on the
turn and we can just get our opponent to fold The Showdown value now if they check back the turn so now we see here
in summary what happens if right if we stab the turn the Broadways and small pairs fold which is good but the asex
calls and we don't have a profitable double barrel on the river because it will mostly call if we check the turn he bets the ASX and we can check raise and
Max fold Equity he Bluffs the Broadway so we get value actually from the Broadways that we can now Bluff and get to fold and if he checks back we just
overb the river to fold the small pairs in almost all scenarios when we check the turn we win so by going through this
what happens if we can determine that yes stabbing the turn could be profitable but checking the turn and
going for the check raise or the overb on the river is probably more profitable all right let's look at another one in
this one our opponent a wreck player on the button is going to open to 20 we're going to three bet in the small blind with the beautiful 10 n of clubs and our
opponent is going to call flop comes Queen Jack four so we do flop an open Ender here and again let's start off by
asking these big picture questions what is their range and what happens if so the range is still going to be
relatively wide maybe looks something like this this is a button defend range to a small blind three bet it's not
perfect but it is a good starting point we see here probably not going to have Aces Kings these hands would just forb
bet probably not going to have the weaker part of their range because these hands wouldn't open and then call three bet whatever they have about 15 16% of
their hands we could quibble with this make it a little bit tighter make it a little bit wider but it is a decent starting point for what their range is
going to look like when we three bet in the small blind all right so now let's go through what happens if so what happens if we see bet here well we just
get to fold out a lot of their better hands right we get to fold out some ACE highs we get to fold out deuces threes
pocket fives through pocket 10s quite a bit here we get a lot of folds from better hands which is pretty good but
what happens if our opponent calls well we have Equity so maybe we decide to continue double barreling on the turn
and our opponent opponent calls again now we get to the river and we just have 10 high here so if we check on this
River we've lost two streets against all of our opponent's range is just going to win here if we bet small In this River
maybe we get some of the ace high and King High fles draws to F but we get snapped off by the queen X and Jack X which we lose three streets against and
if we bet big on this River well we just get snapped off by the strong portions of our opponent's range and the problem
is here when our opponent is in position when we are out of position betting small on the Flop doesn't necessarily Define our opponent's range because
opponents slow play much much much more when they are in position even if the board is wet in dynamic they just have
way less anxiety when they're in position about bad turn cards coming that kill their action in my experience
players just slow play strong hands so so so much more when they are in position early on when Hungry Horse
poker was just starting as a stable we had 20-some players all over the country and our default like it is right now was
when we were in position we're just seab betting our entire range but when we were out of position at that time we were actually SE betting our entire
range as well because we're just like players respond poorly to range bets let's just see BET our entire range and
one of the things that kept happening to our horses is they would just triple barrel in spots like this and just get snapped off by hands like pocket jacks
or queen Jack or pocket fours and they're like well our opponents didn't raise on a wet Dynamic flap and finally
after seeing this over and over and over again we just came to our senses and realized that the population slow plays
quite a bit when they are in position where they almost never slow play on this board when they are out of position
all right so now let's go through what happens if we check if our opponent checks back on this flop what does this mean what we found even though opponents
will not necessarily fast play all the time when we take aggressive action ourselves when we bet even if we bet
small when we check our opponents still massively over stab their good hands right they just want to start putting
money in the pot when they have strong stuff like pocket fors or queen Jack or Ace queen or whatever so when our
opponent checks back the Flop they just have a relatively weak range in general they usually don't have top pair they
don't have two pair they don't have sets so the best hands are going to have our hands like Ace Jack here that are not going to be able to hang on so if our
opponent checks back the Flop we just put in a big bet on the turn to Target all of our opponent's Showdown value it's going to call once and then we just
empty the clip on the river go for the big boy overb we're just not going to run into brick walls here because just
in general our opponents do not check back strong hands even when they're in position when we check to them on white Dynamic boards they just tend to bet
their good stuff themselves when we check to them so we just have a very profitable double barrel Bluff when our opponents check back the Flop all right
so what happens if we check it over and our opponent bets small well now again we have a little bit more information
about our opponent's range Live players in particular tend to split their sizes particularly when the board is wet in
Dynamic such as this board here and when they choose a small size they just tend to have a little bit of a weaker range
they just don't have as much Ace queen queen Jack pocket Jacks pocket fours in the small size now this doesn't mean they never have strong hands in the
small size it just means they don't have nearly enough strong hands so yeah sometimes we can run into a brick wall
here but in general we're going to have some fold Equity here and the more fold Equity we have the less equity in our own hand we need so because we think
we've got quite a bit of fold Equity here we can just check raise the Flop and we can just Jam a bunch of turns our opponent just doesn't have nearly as
strong a range as if they would bet big here so we can just go for the check raise we can get a lot of folds and finally what happens if we check and our
opponent goes big well they're just screaming I have a strong hand right I have Ace Queen I have Queen Jack I have pocket Force so we're not going to have
any fold Equity here when our opponent stabs big so in this particular case we would not want to put in a check raise we just want to check call here and try
to realize our equity on the turn or the river so we see here our summary what happens if in this particular hand if we
see bet well we get our opponent to fold small pockets pairs which is good but the problem comes when our opponent calls because they call with a bunch of
better hands and draws we don't really have a profitable triple barrel bluffing opportunity here when our opponents are
in position because they don't necessarily Define their range when we bet ourselves what happens if we check
well if our opponent checks back our Bluffs print if our opponent bets small we can just check raise quite a bit versus a weak range and if our opponent
bets large we can just check call with our openend and straight draw because we now know that our opponent has a pretty
strong range all right this next hand here we're playing against an aggressive kind of spazzy Pro this guy is playing
for profit but he's very very aggressive we are going to three bet in the small blind with pocket kigle dream scenario and he is going to call flop comes 965
with three clubs and we're playing against recreational players I'm just going to check my entire range here we've already talked about recreational
players make a ton of mistakes versus a check here they tend to Telegraph their hand strength with their bet size but we're not playing against a recreational
player we are playing against a pro my shortcut against Pros is just try to execute a simple strategy on boards that
tend to be good for my opponent's range I'm going to check my entire range on boards tend to be slightly better for my
range I'm just going to bet my entire range when playing against Pros I'm going to have a little bit more nuanced strategy but still keeping it very very
very simple no need to over complicate this this board kind of a connected monotone board I'm probably just going
to be checking my entire range particularly because our opponent is aggressive and I think an aggressive opponent is generally going to make
betting mistakes rather than calling mistakes so I'd like to give our opponent a chance to make those mistakes so I'm just going to check everything
here our opponent's going to bet small hand probably not strong enough to check raise but definitely too good to fold so
we are just going to call here going to a turn which is a three and our opponent checks it back we get to the river which
is a three pairing the board and we've kind of flown through this hand to get to this point because I want to focus on the river in this hand let's ask those
two questions first what is our opponent's range well we can rule out very strong hands like flushes like full
houses those hands would generally just keep betting the turn particularly from an aggressive player if you had a king
High flush an ace high flush are those hands going to bet the Flop and check back the turn no if he had a straight are those hands going to bet the Flop
and check back the turn no probably not if he had a set are those hands going to bet the Flop and check back the turn no
so we can rule out the top of his range here so what is he going to have he's going to have a lot of kind of thin
value Showdown valy hands maybe as some hands like pocket eights pocket sevens 109 suited or Jack n suited right he's
going to have a lot of kind of thin value hands that didn't really feel comfortable going for three streets
that's going to be a pretty big part of his range the other part of his ranges maybe a little bit of air now it's probably not going to be hands that had
a lot of equity on the turn maybe a hand like Ace 10 with the Ace of clubs that hand from an aggressive player would just keep betting so it's not going to
be stuff like that but maybe just complete whiffs right maybe hands like Jack 10 of hearts or queen 10 of Spades
why might he have these hands because well these hands stabbed on the flap they picked up nothing on the turn and
even aggressive players don't really feel comfortable just triple barreling in live poker when they just have air
when they have no equity when they have no backup so in general I think we can split our opponent's range into two categories once again going to be some
Thin value hands and going to be some air so now what happens if what happens if we bet on this River while our
opponent is probably going to call quite a bit if they have the 9x the pocket 8s the pocket sevens Etc because what does
our hand look like when we check call The Flop and then check the turn it looks like we just have a lot of hands like Ace King and Ace Queen so we're
going to get paid here from a thin value if we just come out and bet but what does he do with his air well he just
folds so we win a bet against his kind of thin value or Showdown value if we come out and bet here but the air
portion of his range just folds so now what happens if we check this River well now our opponent we've given him a ton
of rope so I think that air portion of his range the queen High Jack High those type of hands if we check this River
what does our hand look like well it looks like we got Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack something like that that just check called The Flop so what is our opponent
going to do with the air portion of his range we said this guy was aggressive we said he was Spazzy we said he's probably likely to make betting mistakes he's
probably just going to bet when he does have air what is he going to do with a thin value portion of his range if he
has a hand like Jack n suited or pocket eights getting to this River those hands are probably also going to bet for thin
value this is a pro right Pros are capable of betting for thin value and they are capable of bluffing right this
would not be the case if it was a recreational player or a fish most of the time but Pros are capable of these things why might he bet a hand like
pocket eight here on this River well our hand looks like Ace King or Ace Queen right we check called The Flop check
check on the turn and now we're checking on the river it just doesn't look like we have a good hand ever so I think our opponent with a high certainty is very
likely to bet both his air and his thin value on this River so we see here going back to our chart what happens if we bet
the river well he calls a thin value and he folds the air what happens if we check the river well he bets the thin value and he bets the air so again by
going through what happens if when you see a good move look for a better one all right final hand here in this one
we're playing 510 instead of 55 we open on the button with King five of hearts and a recreational player in the big
blind is going to call flop comes Jack 76 I'm just going to choose the size where they raise their strong stuff and
call it their weak stuff notice on this board because it is wet and dynamic we can accomplish that with a small size
whereas in the first hand on the board where it was A7 Deuce our opponent isn't going to call with their weak stuff or
raise their strong stuff on this board it is much more likely that we can accomplish that so we are going to go $40 in our opponent calls we go to a
turn which is a jack here and now the first question we want to ask on this turn is what is our opponent's range so
we can put our opponent's range in kind of three buckets it's going to be a lot of Jack X for trips that makes a lot of
sense it's going to be the strong portion of our opponent's range these hands would always call on the Flop they wouldn't raise most of the time so a lot
of Jacka a lot of trips it's going to be some Showdown value 7x 6X pocket 8s pocket 9 Etc it's going to be some draws
maybe some flush draws maybe some 89 or 54 or 9 10 so it's going to be trips
Showdown value and draws so now let's go through what happens if let's start off if we bet big on this turn right if we
just pot the turn or over bet the turn what does our opponent do well when our opponent has a jack when we just come out and bet big on this turn mostly our
opponent's probably just going to call particularly if they have a hand like Jack n Jack 10 Queen Jack Etc maybe they
raise sometimes with hands like Ace Jack and King Jack but in general the bigger we bet the less our opponents fast play
so I think by choosing this big size on the turn our opponent's just going to call and flat quite a bit with their
Jack X when our opponent has Showdown value they may put us on a draw maybe sometimes they call sometimes they fold
if our opponent has a hand like eights nines tens I think those hands maybe call one more time maybe hand like A7 calls one more time maybe we can get the
weak 7x maybe we get the 6X maybe we get pocket fives or pocket fours maybe we get some of that stuff to fold but in
general I think this is probably going to be a mix here I think The Showdown value portion of our opponent's range sometimes calls sometimes folds and then
the draws here from our opponent again I think that's going to be a mix as well the stronger draws may call the weaker
draws May fold so the problem here getting to this River after our opponent calls our opponent just has a very strong range it's going to be
predominantly Jack X right so we don't really have a profitable Bluff once we
bet big on the turn because we have not defined we have not sculpted our opponent's range getting to this River
and if we bet small on the river won't we just get snapped off by the trips and any Showdown value that got here pocket
10s pocket 9 7x Etc and maybe we fold the ace high flush draws but there's just not a ton of those so betting small
on the river doesn't seem great betting big on the river doesn't seem great because we just get snapped off by the trips what happens if we check back the
turn okay well now we go to a river and let's say our opponent checks and I think still it's some frequency if our
opponent checks on this River they could have Jack X some of the time just trying to trap us trying to induce here some of
the time trying to get us to stab even if we just try to get our opponent to fold hands like pocket eights pocket 9
7x I don't think we're going to be very successful doing that because we look kind of weak when we check back the turn
on these paired boards our opponents gets more sticky so we're going to have to choose a really big size here if we want a fold a hand like pocket eights
and the problem with choosing a big size on this river is our opponents are just going to trap sometimes with hands like Ace Jack King Jack Etc getting to this
River so we're just going to get snapped off quite a bit by the top of our opponent's range the other scenario that
happens when we check back the turn is our opponent just comes out and bets on the river which I guess now is okay
because we don't really lose another bet against the top of their range and get put in a quandry on the river but often
times when we Breck the river we just have to fold our King High finally what if we bet small here on this turn and
when we bet small a few things happen number one when our opponent does have a jack when we bet small on this turn the
the board is wet and dynamic we've chosen a small size our opponents will generally just tend to fast play when they have trips here on this turn so we
just kind of know what our opponent's ranges if we have a king High flush draw here obviously we can just call we're
getting the odds to hit the flush on the river our opponent not really going to have full houses here because hands like pocket sevs or pocket sixes or Jack s
suited or whatever would raise on the Flop so we're kind of getting the odds to just hit our flush on the river then if we get there we can get paid so we
can do quite a lot of calling here and if our opponent just calls here we know with a pretty High certainty that our
opponent's going to have a weaker range getting to the river because the Jacka just raises a lot when we choose a small size the other cool thing is that by
choosing the small size we just make our opponent's range wider getting to the river they're going to have their straight draws they're going to have all
their flush draws they're going to have a lot of their Sixx all their SX Etc so we just have kind of a weaker range to
Bluff on the river we know they don't have full houses because sevens and sixes would mostly raise the flap we know they don't have Jacka because Jack
X would mostly raise the turn we're not really worried about running into a brick wall here on this River and even though our opponents get more sticky on
these paired boards we're just not really worried about running into super strong hands so we can go for the big boy overb and get our opponent to fold
their entire range here on this River once again quick summary what happens if we bet big well jackx calls Showdown
value sometimes folds sometimes calls and draws sometimes fold and sometimes call when we check well when they check
River we have no fold equity and when they bet River we're kind of in a pickle we just have to fold but what happens if
we bet small Jack X raises Showdown value calls draws call we just get to play perfectly because we have now
defined their range all right guys so remember to play like a Crusher two questions what is their range and what
happens if that's it you don't need software you don't need solvers you don't even need the amazing 28-day boot
camp from Hungry Horse poker no you can do this on your own now can we help refine your thought process and get you
there faster yes of course but you guys can do this on your own plenty of Crushers have hopefully this helps and
turns you into the biggest boy possible thank you guys and have a gentle day
