I'm going to show you the nine biggest mistakes low stakes poker Pros are making how do I know this I've spent
nearly 300 hours this year playing 55 and these are the most common blenders I've seen these stronger players make
time and time again so if you are a pro an aspiring Pro or just a part-time
weeken Warrior hopefully this video can help you cut out some of these mistakes and win way more money let's jump in all
right so the first mistake I've seen low STI pros make is generally firing two barrels and then giving up on the river
so I want to talk about why we shouldn't give up on Rivers even if they're perceived to be bad for us and finally I
want to talk about something I just made up called Showdown fallacy where we really need to ask ourselves do we actually have Showdown value on this
River and if not we should not be giving up so let's jump into a couple examples
all right first example here we're playing 25 we're going to open it up on the button and the villain in the big blind a recreational player is going to
call flop comes 1054 we are going to C bet I see a lot of low stakes Pros getting this right and just SE betting
small here which is great the villain is is going to call we're going to a turn which is a king and this is actually a
pretty good card to barrel and once again a lot of low stakes Pros are getting this right we don't have Showdown value we've got some Equity we
should be barreling on the turn this is the size I see a lot of Rags using on these turns kind of the 2/3 to 3/4 pot
not the size I would necessarily use but we're going to talk about this later in the video so we'll move on for now the
double barrel is very good though against a player who's calling to wide pre- flap and calling too wide to a small SE on the flap and now the turn is
a perceived good card for us we're going to have a lot of fold Equity here so we continue barreling which is great now we go to a river which is a 10 and when it
checks to us on the river all too often I see low stakes Pros in this spot think
okay I've opened I've see bet the Flop I've bet the turn now on this River this
is a pretty bad card for us our opponent can have a lot of trips here they're just never folding so let's just check
back and give up yes this card is scary yes our opponent can have a bunch of 10x here but giving up with seven high on
this rer is a giant blender our opponent can have some ace high flesh draws here they can have some Queen High Jack High
flesh draws because of the small size we chose on the Flop our opponent might have even floated with a hand like Queen Jack with the Queen of Spades picked up
a straight draw on the turn and continued to our 2/3 pot size our opponent just has a ton of hands here that are just going to autofold if we
breathe on this pot so giving up on this River even though it is a bad card for us is a huge blender because our
opponent is getting here with way too wide of a range and we can get all of this stuff to fold by just going for a
very very small bet so just because a card is bad for us does not mean we should be giving up yes our opponent is
never folding trip 10 in a million years but that does not mean a bluff on this river is not going to be the most
profitable play all right one more example here and this is a concept I just made up called Showdown fallacy we open on the button again with 76 of
diamonds our opponent calls in the big blind flop is Jack 84 so I believe we have what is known as a belly Buster and
the hero the low stakes Pro in this hand is going to seat on this flop the opponent is going to call turn is a
three and once again our low stakes hero is going to continue firing for the 2/3 or 3/4 pot size on this turn double
barrel is good sizing maybe not my preferred size but we're going to talk about this soon so double barrel on the
turn good now we go to a river which is a seven of spade so this River does a
couple things here when it checks over to us number one it does give us third pair here so it kind of looks like we
have Showdown value but number two it brings in straight draws like 910 or 56
of course it also brings in the Spade fles draws so really on this River what hands do we actually have Showdown value
against when we have opened on the button seabed on the Flop and double barreled on the turn and now pretty much everything gets there on the river is
our opponent really calling with a hand like four five of hearts or pocket sixes or something on the turn when we double
barrel probably not so I really don't think we have a ton of Showdown value in
this spot and I think just checking back is a mistake and you could look at the spot and say yes this card is scary lots
of draws get there our opponent can have some very strong hands in this spot but here's the way I like to look at these spots to keep myself logically
consistent if our opponent flipped over a hand here Queen Jack Jack 10 Jack n
what size would we bet on this River to get those hands to call well I don't think we could go absolutely huge top
pair has now shriveled up in value on this River well maybe we decide if we have pocket 8s here to get a hand like
Queen Jack or Jack n suited to call we'd have to go 110 125 on on this River we
definitely have to go under pot to get a Jack to call if we just bet 175 200
maybe a slight overb now our opponent starts folding King Jack Queen Jack Jack n Jack 10 all of the time and yes we're
going to get snapped off by The Straits we're going to get snapped off by the fleshes but our opponent's going to have so much Jack X here that is just going
to fold if we bet nearly pot the bluff is going to be way more profitable than just checking back and taking our
non-existent Showdown value in this spot because of the way the hand play out we really don't beat anything I'd argue it
is still more profitable to Bluff on this River than to check back all right the next mistake I'm seing low stakes
poker pros make with a high frequency is bluffing uncapped ranges well wait a second Mark I thought you just said we
shouldn't be double barreling and giving up on Rivers well we shouldn't but we also just can't Blast for huge sizes
when our opponent has an uncapped range bluffing is hard and this is why you see low stakes Rags make so many mistakes
with this and generally just turn into a BBC value type nits because calibrating your opponent's range and the right
sizes to Target that range is very very tough so what mistakes am my scene when L Pros are blasting off into uncapped
ranges number one when the villains are check raising flops and checking turns on board pairing cards we'll talk about
that number two when they're choosing large bets on nut changing turns and number three when they are trying to
Bluff villains who are in position when they are out of position so let's put some Crystal Clear concrete examples to
these Concepts I will show you right now all right example number one when I see low stakes Pros just blasting off into
uncapped ranges when our opponents check raise the Flop and then check the turn on a board pairing card so let me show
you the low stakes Pro our hero is going to open on the button and the villain a wreck is going to call in the big blind we flop open-ended we are going to C BET
our opponent is going to check raise well we're open-ended to a Broadway straight draw and we've got a back door flesh draw so we're going to continue in
position turn card is now a 10 and our opponent checks and this is a mistake I'm seeing time and time again when it
checks over to our low stakes Hero on the button they just start betting here on the turn for usually pretty big sizes
because they're like well you know I've got King High our opponent checked our opponent showed weakness no this is a
mistake and let's talk about why when our opponent a low stakes recreational player check raises on the Flop here
what is their range well it's mostly going to be value right because most low stakes recreational players tend to be
more on the passive side so when they check raise on this flop it's going to be heavily weighted towards hands like
Queen 10 pocket fours pocket 10 here right yes they will occasionally have some big combo draws occasionally have
some nut flesh draws occasionally have some straight draws but when we choose a small size on this flap the board is wet the board is dynamic they are going to
almost always raise off their value and they are sometimes going to raise off their draws now getting to the turn when
the turn card pairs the board and why might they check in the spot with their value hands when the board pairs now
they have lock down value they're no longer scared of flushes they're no longer scared of straits they have Queen
10 here they have pocket fours here that would play in this manner a lot of the time so choosing a big size here as the
hero here on the button is a blunder because what's going to happen when our opponent has a full house and we choose
a big size well they are going to call we're going to go to a river look we've still got King High so we need to Bluff
our low stakes Hero has taken our advice into account and is not going to fire two barrels and give up with King High here so he goes ahead and Bluffs on the
river and of course now the villain is going to check raise Jam for the rest of it because they just always have a hand
like Queen 10 or pocket fours here so what is the Alterna here if we don't want to be just blasting off into an
uncapped range on the turn here when our opponent checks instead of choosing this big sizing
$150 maybe we can choose a very small size what happens if we go 60 or 70 or
80 here so number one by going small on this turn instead of 150 we keep those draws in our opponent's range and number
two when we choose a small size here if our opponent does have pocket fours or queen 10 they are much more incentivized
to check raise us because we've chosen in such a small size and they just get greedy and want to put more money in if they just call on this turn often times
they just come out and donk on the river and let us off the hook so if our opponent just calls on this turn if we
go small now on the river we can choose a small size again because yes our
opponent will sometimes just come out and check raise Queen 10 or pocket fours or sometimes just come out and donk those hands as well on the river but
sometimes you're playing against a super trappy player who will just check again on the river to try to give us a little bit of rope what what size do we need to
go on an eight of Hearts River here to make a hand like Ace three of diamonds or kingj Jack of clubs fold well we
don't need to go big we can just go very very very small maybe quarter pot fifth
pot because what is our opponent's range well it's going to be full houses and it's going to be some some draws and we
don't need to go very big at all to get those draws to fold we can just go absolutely tiny on this River and
because we went tiny on the turn we allowed our opponent to get to this River with some of those draws now we just need to breathe on the pot go very
very small to get those draws to fold and we lose the absolute minimum when our opponent does have a full house while still being able to occasionally
take down this pot with just King High now just for context I want to show you this same spot except a different turn
card so let's say same situation on the Flop we see that our opponent check raises now the turn is a deuce of diamonds bringing in the front door
flush and our opponent checks here and in this spot is our opponent capped or uncapped remember when the 10 came in on
the turn we said our opponent can just have a ton of full houses that they would check and I would pause it here that when our opponent checks now this
is completely different why are they capped on this turn what hands does our opponent mostly raise on the Flop Queen
10 pocket fours pocket 10 it's going to be a lot of their value hands how do their value hands feel on this turn when
the flesh comes in they feel like they have shriveled up in value and you may be thinking well why can't our opponent have a flush here and I'm never going to
say never but our opponent never has a flush here if our opponent is kind of a passive player who's going to trap with
their flushes here on this turn is that type of player the one who's going to play their draws aggressively and check Rays on the Flop usually not what type
of player is going to play their Ace High flush draws or their combo draws aggressively on the Flop usually going to be a more aggressive player and if
they are an aggressive player when they get there on the turn are they going to be the type to slow down in check
usually not so usually the players who are going to play their flush draws fast are the ones who are going to be aggressive and they're going to continue
firing on this turn so I would say yes occasionally once in 6 million years our opponent can have a flush here but it's
going to be very very rare unlike when the board pairs on the turn and our opponent's range here is mostly going to
be two pair and set I'm not going to tell you hey try to make opponents at low stakes fold two pair and sets
because I think generally 98% of the time you are lighting money on fire but
in this particular spot when you are deep when the obvious draw came in when our opponent checks this is the one spot
in live poker where I think our opponents will often lay down two pair in sets if we have enough stack depth
left behind so this is a spot where I would actually bet big on the turn because our opponent is never folding
Queen 10 pocket fours pocket 10 here in a million years just with the caveat we want to make sure we leave behind that
big boy overb Bluff on the river so if we go 150 here and our opponent calls pot will be 515 going to the river we
have a massive bet still left behind when our opponent checks now we can jam and I think this is maybe the one spot
in live poker we can get our opponents to fold some of those two pair and sets and I just wanted to point out how different this is when our opponent
check raises the Flop and checks the turn when a board pairing card comes in versus when a flushing card comes in all
right back to our handy dandy little chart here the next mistake I see low sakes Pros making when bluffing UNCA ranges is using large bets on nut
changing turns so let me show you in example in this one our hero the low STI Pro is going to open on the button with
ace9 offit and the villain a wreck in the big blind is going to call BP comes Queen 76 we are going to C BET our
entire range opponent calls now the turn is a six and our hero the low stakes Pro is going to continue barreling for 70
into 85 on this turn I want to talk about why this is a mistake when we choose this big size on a nut changing
card on the turn what's going to happen when our opponent has a six here they are often just going to call because
they're scared of the flush coming in so trips are just going to call when our opponent has maybe a small flush a baby
flush a nine High flush an eight High flush a five High flush they are often just going to call two now the board is
paired they're scared of Full Houses they're scared of higher fleshes so our opponent will start trapping at a much
higher frequency it's not that they're trapping because they're trying to do some trick feel helmouth [ __ ] no they're trapping because they start
getting scared because you've chosen a big size twice and they're not sure even if they're very strong hand is good so
now that we've chosen this big size on the turn and our opponent calls we get to the river and we're like well you know what we've got the nut flush
blocker let's just continue blasting here let's Bluff and then we get snapped off and our opponent says flush or our
opponent says trips and then they flip over their hand and we just have to say you're good this is the mistake if
instead of going 70 we choose a small size maybe $30 $35 on this turn it will
incentivize our opponent to raise a ton of the time here on the turn when they have flushes themselves if they have the
five High flush if they have the nine High flesh they will start putting in more money for us because when we put in
a small BET our opponent is no longer as scared fear and our opponent starts wanting a little bit more money in the
pot greed with their very strong hands because we have chosen a small size our opponent is going to fast play their
fleshes at a much higher frequency and they're also going to continue with a bunch of draws that just aren't going to
be able to withstand Heat on the river maybe hands like 89 suited maybe hands like 54 suited maybe even hands like
pocket eights with a club here that are just going to call here on the turn quite a bit and then are just going to
have to fold a lot on the river and you may be saying well wait Mark aren't we on balanced here what if we have a hand
like Ace N9 of clubs for the ace high flush wouldn't we want to bet big here on the turn no because if we bet small
our opponent will often put in more money for us when they have a flush our opponent will continue with a bunch of
hands that we have drawing dead like eight n of diamonds or 5'4 of Spades or something like that by betting small on
this turn betting small on the nut changing cards is good both when we have value and when we have Bluffs all right
finally back to our handy dandy little chart mistake number three when bluffing uncapped ranges is bluffing villains in
position when we are out of position and they are in position so let me show you all right so our low stakes hero here is
going to open in the cuto off the villain a wreck is going to call on the button flop comes Ace 104 and in this
hand our opponent is going to cat the villain is going to call all turn is a blank our opponent's going to continue
for the 2/3 pot size that all low stakes Rags love to use and the villain is going to call again river is a deuce
we've gotten here with Queen high this board is pretty good for our range we block Ace Queen and Ace Jack which is
something a lot of low stakes Pros are obsessed with I'm not really sure why so we are going to go for the bluff and our
opponent is just going to snap it off with a hand like ace4 or A6 and we are left here wondering well why didn't our
opponent fast play and early on when we started as just a stable and we had players all over the country our
protocol out of position in single race pots was the same as it was in position we were just seab betting all the time
we were just double barreling whenever we had air and we kept seeing our players over and over and over again when they would triple barrel when they
were out of position when the villain was in position they just kept running into brick walls they kept running into
strong hands which didn't happen when it was the opposite when we were in position we just didn't run into the brick walls but the problem is when our
opponents are in position they will trap a lot more they will slow play a lot more the reason being they get to act
last they're not as scared as bad cards coming because they get to see what we do first so this is when we completely
changed our approach and started checking so much more out of position because when we check on a flop like
this our opponent will almost always bet when they have a set when they have two pair when they have a strong ax sure they'll check back some of the weak ax
they'll check back some of the 10x that's fine but by them checking back on this flop because our opponent stab so
much when we check to them and also our opponents Telegraph their hand strength with their sizing when we check to them checking allows us to get so much
information about our opponent's range and play perfectly and when our opponents do check back well now we know with a pretty high certainty our
opponents don't have hands like Ace 4 or Ace 10 or pocket 10 or Ace Queen and so when our opponent check back now we have
the green light to Bluff with hands like Queen High because our opponent has told us in no uncertain terms excuse me sir I
just don't have any strong hands once we made this change and started checking our entire range out of position our
horses Bluff profitability went through the roof is that a word profitability anyway if you find when you are out of
position that your opponents are trapping too much when you go bet bet bet try considering a range check
strategy on the Flop to allow our opponents to cap themselves because when our opponents check back now our Bluffs
will print all right another big mistake I'm seeing low Saks pros make we've touched on this before so we'll fly
through this briefly is autopilot turn sizes and I'm seeing a lot of sizes that in my opinion are too small on blanks
and too large on nut changing cards too many sizes that are kind of in between that don't really accomplish anything so
let me show you a couple examples all right in this one our lows hero is going to open on the button with pocket kges
villain a wreck in the big blind is going to call Queen n Deuce we're going to see BET our entire range so far so
good turn is now a complete blank the innocuous four of hearts and when our opponent checks over all too often I'm
seing low stakes Pros choose this kind of 2/3 to 3/4 pot size and in my opinion this is a giant giant blunder why is
this a blunder on the turn well let's think about our opponent's range when our opponent check calls a small bet on
a flop on a wet Dynamic board they're no longer going to have a lot of hands like Queen n pocket 9es pocket Deuces those
hands on a wet Dynamic board are going to raise on the Flop so what is our opponent's range here well we can pretty
much put our opponent's range in three buckets here it's going to be a lot of top pair it's going to be a lot of draws
maybe Ace High flush draws and straight draws and it's going to be a lot of weak stuff maybe hands like pocket 8s 9x dece
X stuff like that on this turn by choosing this middling size the weak stuff is probably going to fold to a
double barrel no matter what we're not capturing another Street against pocket 8s so this $60 size just doesn't really
get value against those hands and the hands like Ace queen king queen queen Jack or the draws like Ace three of
Spades or Jack 10 here on this turn would call a much bigger size than 60 my preferred size on this turn when the
turn is a blank when our opponent is capped is going much bigger here in choosing an overb size what's the
biggest size at a hand like Queen Jack or queen 10 or Ace 8 of Spades will call on this turn and in my opinion I think
those buckets of hands would call a much bigger bet maybe 100 maybe 120 and we want to Pile in money when our opponents
are most in elastic and our opponents are going to be more in elastic on the turn than they are on the river because
if our opponent does have a hand like Ace eight of spades or Jack 10 here on this turn they have a ton of possibilities they can still make the
nuts they're going to still put in more money to see that River Card whereas when the River card comes a blank well now we're no longer getting any money
from our opponents we need to get the money right here right now on the turn also when our opponent has a queen X
Type holding they still put you on a bunch of semi Bluffs and draws and they are not folding top pair here on the turn so we may as well go much bigger on
a blank all right so back to our guide here and we see two small on blanks which you talked about and now we see two large on nut changing turns so let's
talk about this one all right so so this time our hero the LTI pro has Ace three of spades on the button and we've
briefly touched on this before so we'll go through it very quickly we see bet on the Flop small our opponent call so far so good now the turn is a four of Spades
giving us the nuts and we see a $60 bet into 85 using this size when the flush
comes in is a poor choice because what is our opponent's range well our opponent's range we can put in three
buckets here it's going to be top pair type Holdings like Queen X it's going to be very weak Holdings like pocket eights
with a spade or Jack 10 of hearts or it's going to be flushes if we bet big
on this turn the queen X may start folding the weak stuff is going to fold and the flushes might just call because
they're scared of a bigger flush if we bet small on this turn the queen X is probably going to call at least one more
bet the weak stuff that we have drawing dead like Jack 10 of hearts or something like that may call a bet because we're
giving them a good price and the flushes when we bet very small will probably start check raising here because those hands get greedy when we bet a small
size and they're not as scared of running into a bigger flush so by betting small here we just get way more
value against our opponent's range on a nut changing card all right the next mistake I'm seeing low scks pros make is
checking back turns when we have no Showdown value so in general are villains the wreck players we're playing
against at low stakes they tend to call pre- flap too wide they tend to call the flap too wide they tend to raise their
strong hands on the Flop too often so what does that mean for us we should just Barrel turns because our opponents
have very very weak ranges so let me show you all right so the low sticks Pro our hero has 8 seven of Spades opens on
the button villain is going to call we've got a couple back doors here we are going to CET and the recck player in
the big blind calls now the turn is a three we don't have anything and the mistake I am seeing low sticks Pros here
make as well we didn't pick up Equity we didn't pick up a spade we didn't pick up a straight draw we didn't pick up a pair
let's just check back here on this turn now the problem here is the villain usually just comes out and bets on the
river and we are forced to fold a high let's talk about why this is a mistake
once again when we open on the button villains are just going to defend the big blind way too wide when we see bet
on the flap they are just going to raise their strong hands at too high of a frequency they're going to raise hands like pocket sixes pocket Deuce Queen six
suited so getting to the turn most of their range is going to be one pair hands and yes you could say here in this
spot well we're never going to get a hand like Ace queen or king queen to fold by the river and in my opinion that
is not true if you choose the right sizes but let's just say for argu argument sake it is which is fine our
opponent still has a ton of hands here they still have flush draws they still have pocket sevens they still have just
ace high hands that they floated us with on the Flop if you're going to be doing a lot of seab betting on the Flop we
need to be following up with turn double barrels a lot of the time even if we don't pick up Equity because our
opponents are just going to get to turns with such weak crippled ranges because they call too much pre- flop and raise
too many strong hands on the Flop so I guess my advice here is just double barrel all the time if we have air and
if you're not comfortable with that that's okay but we probably shouldn't be seab betting range on most flops if
we're not comfortable double barreling turns maybe we should just be checking back our kind of air or low Equity hands
quite a bit on the Flop then we can see what our opponent does on the turn our opponent will usually come out and bet their Queen X or their very strong hands
on the turn and if our opponent checks again well now we have to get comfortable double barreling with the air on the turn or the river either way
a lot of money is there to be made against recreational players by double barreling turns even if we do not pick
up Equity remember Equity is our get out of jail free card and the more Equity we
have the less fold Equity we need but against most low stakes recreational players we have so much fold equity on
turns and rivers because their range is so wide and so weak double barrel the turns win rate will go up all right the
next mistake I'm seeing low pros make is just way too passive against other Pros
or rare and my advice here is don't be afraid to battle variance is okay and EV
is EV what I mean by that is if there are Pros in the game who are making
mistakes you can still be winning money off of them you don't win money by just avoiding them and only playing pots
against fish in general yeah you want to play the most pots against the fish but the weaker Rags can be exploited as well
and if you can win another half big blind or one big blind or 1.5 big blinds
per hour by beating up on some of the weak Rags well your win rate will just go up and yeah you might say Okay edges
are smaller so variant will get higher and the way I like to look at this is the higher our win rate the less our
down swings right if we are the biggest winner in the pool if we are taking every single spot every single time well
even if we have higher swings session to session if you're winning 15 16 17 big
blinds per hour over a 250 hour sample you are just never going to lose right
no matter how high the variance is you are just never going to lose over even like a TW Monon sample playing live
right so take every spot push your edges and don't worry about variance because
the higher the win rate the less you will have to worry about those wild down swings so example number one here
villain a pro who happens to have some neck tattoos and some tattoos on his
hands and is doing a low stakes challenge here is going to open in the lowjack US the low stakes Pro we are
going to call here in the hijack with Ace King to let in all the other recreational players behind this is okay
I'd like flatting with some strong hands here because our incentive is to let the fish in who are going to make 100 big
blind mistakes post flop a wreck player in the big blind comes along as well flop comes 533 the villain is going to
se bet small we are going to call here with Ace King already a bit precarious may just be throwing this away when the
villain SE bets into two other people here but we're going to call turn is a king of hearts bringing in a backdoor
fles draw villain is going to continue here very small for about 28.63 4% of the pot and we are going to
elect to call and I think at this point in the hand is when we need to be thinking about putting some more money
into the pot we have top pair top kicker the board is relatively wet and dynamic
I think in the spot the villain could be bluffing with a bunch of hands with Equity with his spay draws with his back door heart draws he could also just be
betting worse for Value here right he could also just be betting pocket Jacks pocket 10 pocket Queens something like
that for Value here on this turn now the river is a nine of Spades and when villain checks we just have the best
hand here 90% of the time what actually happens here in this hand our hero the low Saks Pro checks back here and I
think at some point in this hand finding a turn raise or on this River when the villain checks betting for thin value at
some point we just need to be putting in more money even though that villain is a little bit scary we just need to find an
opportunity ourselves to put in more money here with top pair top kicker either on the turn or on the river all
right next one here and the villain once again A very handsome tattooed boy is
going to open on the button we are the Low sck Pro and the small blind and we have pocket aces and we are just going to Flat because we notied this guy is
just opening on the button without looking at his cards this is a mistake right look I'm completely on board with
the flatting the Ace King off early versus is early to let in the fish when we have pocket aces I am just always
putting in more money pre- flop specifically when this is a late vers late configuration this is just too
passive right I could get on board with the Ace King off suit flat early vers early I can't really get on board with
flatting pocket aces to a button open and yes you could just say Okay this guy's just going to fold a lot of the
time because we notice he's just opening all of the hands on the button okay he's also just going to for bet a lot or he's
also just going to call a lot we need to be piling in more money with the top of our range this is not the spot to Flat
to let fish in the pot so we are going to call flap comes Jack 63 our opponent's seab bets and now we're going
to check raise choosing a very small size here our opponent calls turn is a King of Spades we're going to follow up
here with a 2/3 pot siiz bet because that's the size we use because we're a low stakes Pro our villain is going to
call River is a deuce of Spades and even though it's very unlikely that our opponent has a flush here I mean I guess
he could have 6X of Spades but very unlikely uh we are going to to check here and our opponent is going to check
back and we are good with pocket aces so this just another spot where we're just
playing a little bit too passive with our value hands yes we did get a check raise in we did get a turn Barrel in but
this should be a three bet pot there should be much more money in going to the Flop and if we are going to trap with Aces which I do not recommend ever
this River just needs to be a mandatory value bet here overall we are just hurting our win rate by playing too
passively against other Rags all right next mistake I'm seeing low sticks pros make in general they can go thin or they
can Bluff but usually they can't do both right some can go super thin for Value some can find the big boy Bluffs most
can't put it all together if they could they would generally be playing bigger so let me show you a couple examples and
maybe you can use this to start either exploiting the rags in your pool who fall into one of these two categories or
maybe we can use it to find kind of our own internal bias and if we're the type of player who maybe is comfortable going thin but not bluffing maybe we could
look Inward and kind of shift this for ourselves let me show you some examples all right so in this one the villain is going to open in the cut off a
recreational player our low stakes hero on the button is going to three bet with the king queen off we are going to C bet
on the Flop and get called we're going to double barrel on the turn for Value probably go a little bit bigger here just to get the spr under one but
neither here nor there the opponent is going to call River is a five pairing the board and this is just a pretty good
spot to go for value our opponent's going to get sticky here on this River with pocket n pocket 10 pocket Jacks
quite a bit because the spr is only one because all of the draws bricked because our opponent does not really put us on
much Queen X in a three B pot so we are going to jam the river and our opponent is going to call and we are good so
there's this type of opponent you often see at small Stakes who is quite capable of going for thin value here and often
gets paid a lot of money in these spots and then there is this type of opponent who when they have a bluff in the same
type of spot they are quite comfortable emptying the clip with a hand like Jack 10 here and just firing on the river and
they win quite a bit of money in these spots because they apply a lot of pressure and they're able to get some
big boy Bluffs through but in general from what I've seen low stakes Pros pretty much hard fall into one of these
two categories either they are like the first player they are comfortable thin value betting but they just are massively under bluffing in almost every
spot when all the money goes in or they are quite comfortable running the big boy Bluffs but you just don't see them
go very thin on Rivers so when they put all the money in they're very polarized on Rivers if you can use this in your
game to kind of start putting those low stakes Pros into categories either number one or number two you can play
much more effectively against them and once again we could kind of use this and look inward on ourselves to see which
category we can fall in and if we're a thin value boy maybe we can start emptying the clip on Bluffs a little bit
more and if we are a bluff boy maybe we can start finding some more spots to get a little bit more comfortable going thin
for Value all right next mistake I'm seeing low s pros make is no delayed gratification there is a massive lack of
patience right it's hard to check the turn or check the river again after the Flop goes check check when we have no
Showdown value but what this this does is it limits our Bluff opportunities and reduces our fold Equity because of this
lack of patience so let me show you in example all right so our low STI Pro is the hero in the big blind here a Trine
wreck is going to open on the button we are going to call in the big blind with Queen Jack flop comes Ace 106 our low
stakes Pro checks it over and the villain on the button checks it back and a question I'm always asking here is
what is their range well on this board when a trying player checks back I think their range is squarely going to be
Showdown value hands here right maybe weak Ace X maybe 10x maybe hands like pocket 9es maybe hands like pocket kings
queens Jacks here why is our opponent not going to have top of range look how deep we are we're 200 big blinds deep in
a single race pot there's almost no money out there if our opponent is a trying thinking player here on the button if they have pocket 10s if they
have pocket sixes if they have Ace 10 ace6 they are generally just going to bet their strong hands if they have air
if they have a hand like 89 or a gut shot or a complete whiff on this board they're also generally going to bet
because it's an ace high double bro Way Board everybody knows that's a good board for the pre- Flop Razer so they're generally just going to bet their air
they're going to bet their strong stuff the stuff that generally gets checked back here is their Showdown value this is what I'm talking about in this
delayed gratification and not having the patience all too often I see low stakes Pros here in our position in the big line just come out and bet the turn our
opponent on the button calls we go to a river and we bet again we go for the overb here right this is pretty good we need to double barrel with our Queen
high and then we just get snapped off because our opponent shows up with a hand Ace three suited or pocket kings
here that just checked back the flop because their plan was just to click call call but if we can just wait one
more beat here and find one more check what is our opponent going to do when they have hands like ace3 when they have
hands like pocket kings when they have hands like Jack 10 suited if we check twice well they are going to bet almost
all of those hands on the turn so now when our opponent bets now we can go for the big boy check raise our opponent's
often going to call with their ax at least one time we get to a river we can put in all the money and we can just get
our opponents to fold almost everything because they're just not going to have much to pair or sets or Straits when
they check back on this flop check raising maximizes fold Equity it allows us to Pile in much more money so using
that delayed gratification just checking often one more time being patient
waiting that one extra beat can really really really maximize fold equity and increase the efficiency of our Bluffs
all right next mistake I'm seeing low stakes pros make is just assuming everyone is like me so what do I mean by
that well if we are the type of player who Bluffs all the time right just assuming that the rest of the player
pool also Bluffs and so we start calling too much often times I see the players
who are very Bluff happy are often kind of stationing because they just assume other players are Bluff happy and also
the players who are under bluffing kind of the nitty type tight players ABC value type guys who are massively under
bluffing and just betting whenever they have value those players are often folding too much because they're
assuming again everyone kind of plays like them well I'm just not bluffing here I just have value so I guess my
opponent isn't bluffing so I fold so my general advice here is try to distance
ourselves not make ourselves the hero of the story just because we are over bluffing does not mean the pool is over
bluffing right just because we are under bluffing does that mean the pool is under bluffing right so hopefully the
goal is to get to a point where we make decisions based upon what the pool is doing rather than based around what we
are doing or what we are thinking and you can uses to exploit the pros in your pool remember if you're against a bluff
happy Pro these are often the type you can go super super thin for Value against because these guys don't like to
fold and also if you are against a player who's just kind of on the tighter niter side who when he bets he has it
these are the players you can often Bluff quite a bit because they will just tend to believe you because when they put in money they have it and they
assume everybody is like them all right finally the last mistake I'm seeing low stakes pros make when you put them into
the jungle they put on a Parker they just get confused so what do I mean by
this well I'm talking about when we pull them out of their comfort zone they usually make poor adjustments people
like to stick to what they know and if we put them in a spot where they have just never seen before they are utterly
confused they tend to make massive massive blenders so let me show you a couple of examples all right so in these
hands we are actually going to be the hero and the low stakes Pro is actually going to be the villain here so the
villain the low stakes Pro is going to open we are going to flat on the button with pocket 99's flop comes Jack n Deuce
what do you know and what I have been seen is a lot of the pros here in the pool have started checking their entire
range to me out of position in single raise pots I find because they have not
studied this strategy they haven't really thought about how they're going to play their range when I bet small how they're going to play their range when I
bet big how they're going to play their range when I check back they're just often making many many more mistakes and
they're kind of just playing right into my hand here because I have thought about how I'm going to play when they check their entire range and most Pros
are simply as Charlie wilmouth likes to describe pre-f flop charts in trench coats if you pull them into unfamiliar
territory they just generally become fish so most of these guys checking their entire range to me they don't
really know how to play this strategy they're either not check raising nearly enough or they're check raising far too
often getting to turns if I do check back the flap they're just either massively under bluffing or massively over bluffing they're just making huge
huge mistakes because they're not comfortable with this check range strategy they haven't really thought about it outside of watching one of
these videos one time and seeing it's the strategy that I employ all right so let me show you a more concrete example
here in this hand again we are the hero and the villain is going to be our Pro here in the big blind a very short stack
opens to 25 from under the gun in pocket aces I've talked about this before I'm just always piling in more money 99 % of
the time but because this guy only starts with $6 in his hand and the rest of the table behind me is generally deep
I actually like to deviate here and just flat because I want either someone behind me who is deep to squeeze or
other players who are deeper at least to come into the pot so we can win more money so I just call here with Aces the
button a short stack is going to call now our villain in the big line is going to take the bait and squeeze at this point because this is a thinking winning
player I think he can have a lot more hands than just top of range here now he's probably going to be going linear which means good better best but this is
a massive squeeze and I know this guy's just going to be aggressive post flop he's going to bet thinly for Value he's
going to be willing to Bluff and I think just flatting here is going to give him the most amount of rope so I'm just
going to call with Aces and now the button is going to jam all in for $35 more we both call we go to a flop 1075
and I do think this opponent is checking his entire range to me on the Flop now if this was a heads up spot I would just
consider checking my entire range back because the spr is just over one here by checking back he may just put in all the
money for me with his Bluffs and if he does have a hand like pocket jacks or pocket Queens for value or something like that by checking back he's going to
put in the money anyway with those hands because this is a dry side pot I actually elect to bet very very small
here because I think our opponent is less incentivized to Bluff because there is a dry side pot and if he has a hand
like King high or ace high here well he still got to beat the short stack on the button so it doesn't really make sense
for him to Bluff so I just go for a very small bet here our opponent check raises puts in all the money we Snap It Off
board Runs Out 77 and our opponent has pocket Jacks here and we scoop this pot
once again I think just kind of being unfamiliar with this what do we do when we check range in this spot have not
studied the spot have not really applied it and opponents the villain in this hand just start making mistakes when
they are playing an unfamiliar strategy all right a different example here in this one a pro is going to open in the
hijack now the villain on the button who is the low stakes Pro the villain in his hand is going to three bet we look down
at pocket aces in the big blind second best hand in poker so we're going to put in the cold forb folds back around to
the original Three better the pro on the button who is going to call flap comes Ace 109 I going to choose a very very
small size here on this flap because I think when we choose this kind of 10 12% pot size at number one encourages our
opponent to call with hands that we have essentially drawing dead like pocket Jacks pocket Queens pocket kings here on
this flop so we'd like to get another Street against those hands that we have drawing fa thinly or almost dead here so
I go very small our opponent calls turn is now a Deuce of Clubs and now I have this you know voice flashing in my head
from gethin and I remember him telling me once Rags make the most mistakes in lines with checks in them huh so what
happens on this turn if we bet well we're going to get another street from their asex and their draws of course they're going to fold their kings queens
and Jacks now if the river is a blank and maybe we get to stack Ace King and Ace Queen if the river is a blank but we
don't get any more money against the draws and if the river brings in a draw well now we may not get any more money
in against Ace King or Ace Queen so a lot of time here if we just bet the turn from his stronger parts of his range we
might only get two streets but what happens if we check what are most low STI Pros going to do if they have a hand
like Ace King or Ace Queen they're mostly going to bet if they have flush draws or straight draws they're mostly going to bet and then we can just Pile
in the money and they're basically going to be committed here they're going to be in a real [ __ ] spot so we are going to
check our opponent is going to take the bait he's going to bet relatively big here we are going to put in all the
money our opponent snaps it off and river is the innocuous three of diamonds our opponent says he has Ace King and we
scoop a $4,200 pot so yes we ran good here in this spot we had pocket aces against his
Ace King on an ace high board in a four bet pot but by choosing an unconventional line essentially throwing
him into the jungle we were able to Pile in 800 plus big blinds in this spot and
I think if the roles were reversed if we had Ace King and he had pocket aces in this exact same spot yes we would lose a
lot of money but I do not think we would get stacked so taking these unconventional lines throwing your
opponent in the jungle where they are going to be uncomfortable where they are going to be in unfamiliar territory this
is how to win a ton of money against low stakes Pros all right guys so hopefully this video is Illuminating in showing
how you can exploit some of the low stakes Pros in your games and maybe even showing some of the leaks that you can
patch yourself to go from being a low stakes rig to a high stakes rig hope this video turns you into the biggest
boy possible thank you guys and have a gentle day
