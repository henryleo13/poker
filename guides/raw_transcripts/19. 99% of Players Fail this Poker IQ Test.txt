[Music] let's play a game most poker players think they know what to do in tough spots but do they really today we're
putting your poker IQ to the test I'm throwing you into real hands from pre-f flap to the river and you're going to
have to make the best decision at every step keep track of your score Because by the end you'll know if you're playing at a really high level or if you've got
some serious leaks to fix I'd bet less than 1% of players get a perfect score
you ready let's jump in all right so we're going to start off with pre flop here and hand number one a fish opens in
the cutoff 220 and we are on the button here with pocket sixes there are two
solid Rags here in the small blind and big blind so question number one in this spot do we fold call or three bet to $60
Take 5 seconds and make your
decision in this spot we should be three betting to $60 we have a fish who opens
we want to play pots heads up in position against players we're going to have a skill Edge on a live fish is
going to under for bet so they're just going to let us realize our Equity they're really only going to for bet with the top of the range which means
we're going to get to see a flop a high percentage of the time we're essentially shutting out the two players who know what's going on here at the table the
rags in the blinds and we're just getting heads up with a player we're going to have a skill Edge on in position which is an A+ 10 out of 10
situation for us all right next situation a lowjack player who is on the more passive side opens to 25 and this
player does have a limp range which means sometimes you'll see him limp with some of his weaker or middling hands
from up front now he opens 5x to 25 we're next to act in the hijack here and unless otherwise noted we're starting
off all these hands 200 big blinds or $1,000 deep in a 255 game so we're in the hijack with 98 of Hearts here should
we fold call or three bet to
$75 so in this spot I would actually be folding with 8 n of hearts because this
player from the lowjack has a limping range which means when they open from up front they are just going to have too
strong of a range particularly when they open to a 5x size so we see here in an extreme scenario if a player is only
opening 7.5% of hands which is a very very tight range this should be our continue range from the hijack here
because this player is opening such a strong range right they're just limping with all of the middle in the bottom of their range so when they open
particularly from 5x from up front they just have a super strong range and you see here this is Extreme this would be
if they're opening top 7.5% of hands but even if they're opening say 15% of hands
we still want to be extremely extremely tight with our three betting because their open range is extremely extremely
tight and not only do we have to worry about them having a strong range we have to worry about one of the players behind us waking up with a top three or 5% hand
so you see here 89 of Hearts not even close 89 suited should just be folded pre- flop against a player who has a
limpi range and is now opening from up front all right next hand here and this this one the lowjack is going to open to
20 once again 25 a th000 effective with the whole table here the cut off is going to call buttons going to call and
it is around to us in the big blind with seven six of Spades here in this spot
should we fold call or three bet squeeze to
$120 so in this particular spot I think our hand is too good to fold a direct suited connector and I would just be
calling I would not be squeezing here in this spot because when one player opens and then there is a field caller or
multiple field callers we are just very very likely to see a flop even if we three bet here so we want to choose a
linear range when we're squeezing here which just means good better best this hand does not fall into that category
let me show you so at 200 big blinds when squeezing against a relatively tight open from the lowjack we would want our range to look something like
this you see it is all those hands in the upper left corner of the hand balloon chart it's just our good hands right ace Queen off plus all of our
Suited ways pocket eights plus it is just going to be good good good hands you see we're just never squeezing with
76 suited 65 suited ace4 suited Etc right it doesn't make sense to squeeze
with a hand like ace4 suited or ace5 suited if our opponents are just going to be calling with hands like ace8
suited and ace9 suited we want to squeeze with hands that are going to be able to dominate our opponent's calling range because when there is an open and
then when there is a call in the field we are just very unlikely to get it through we're very likely to see a flop playing out of position so we want just
good hands that can dominate our opponents so with 76 of Spades here I would be inclined just to call this one
a good rag opens in the lowjack here we're in the hijack next to act with pocket tens and notice the rest of the
table is fish right we've got a fish in the cut off button small blind and big blind all fish behind us and the one good rag at the table has opened in the
lowjack so in this spot do we fold call or three bet to
$60 all right so in this particular spot I would actually be calling here when a
good rag opens particularly from early position I want to be playing a polar range meaning I'm going to be three betting the very very best hands here
that can cooler the rag when he opens hands like kings Aces Ace King suited Etc and then the hands that are going to
be at the bottom of my continue range the general Crux of this strategy is we want to play pots with the players who
going to make the biggest mistake so we want to let the fish in the pot because these are the guys who are going to be making the 100 200 big blind mistakes
probably not the rag who's opening a tight range from the lowjack right so we just don't want to be three bet isoing
the rags nearly as much as we would the fish we want to let the fish in the pot so my continue range versus a rag
lowjack open with all fish behind might look something like this you see we're three betting the very very top of our
range Aces Ace King suited pocket kings and then the bottom of our continue range which actually looks pretty tight because this is a lowjack versus High
Jack configuration so our worst suited Broadways King Jack Queen Jack Jack 10 suited maybe an ace five suited so you
see here the middle of our range the Queens Jacks tens king queen suited Ace Queen suited the middle of our range is
just going to be a flat from a rag open when there are all fish behind we are incentivized to let the fish into the
pot and just for an AB comparison this would maybe be my range when a rag opens in the cut off and we are on the button
and we've got two fish in the blinds you see this range gets much wider the top of our range gets wider for Value we're now three betting Queens Jacks Ace Queen
suited all the time and the bottom of our range sinks down a couple notches too right now we're just three betting
maybe the 9x hands the suited connectors the worst suited ax hands and now we're just call with a bunch of those hands in
the middle king queen suited Queen 10 suited Jack 10 suited pocket 9es eights Etc all those pocket pairs right the
later the configuration gets the wider the top of our range and The Wider the bottom of our range gets but the general
Mo stays the same when a rag opens when there are fish behind we generally are incentive to play a polarized rather
than a linear range all right moving along with our pre-f flap test now a rig opens in the cut off and a fish calls on
the button and we are in the big blind with pocket nines so in this spot do we fold call or three bet squeeze to
$100 so in this spot even though a rag opened I would still be squeezing to
$100 once somebody opens and then somebody calls or multiple players call I don't care if the player who opened is
a rag a fish a whale whatever once there is a bunch of dead money in the pot the fish already put his money in the pot
we're not shutting out fish behind us right at this point I would just be squeezing and when we squeeze we just want to be going linear linear linear
this hand falls into that category good better best maybe squeezing hands like pocket eights plus here all of our
suited Broadways all of our good suited ax Etc right just our very good hands nines falls into that category I would
be squeezing in this spot all the time all right next hand here and we open Ace Queen of Diamonds in the cut off and a
solid rag is going to three bet us to $60 on the button back around to us and
in this spot do we fold call or put in the forb bet to
$200 so in the spot against an aggressive rag who is capable of three betting relatively wide on the button I
would almost always be putting in the four bet in this situation against a capable player when we are 200 Big lines
deep and out of position we want to be for betting a linear range because when our opponent three bets hands like Ace
Jack suited or Ace 10 suited or king queen suited they are going to be doing quite a bit of calling when they are in
position so once again when our opponent's doing a lot of calling we want hands that can just out pip them and Ace Queen suited would certainly
fall into that category so we see here 200 Big line solved range here against an aggressive opponent when we're out of
position just want to be forbing very very linear Queens Kings aces in there all the time Ace King in there all the
time Ace Queen suited in there all the time and then just working in a sprinkling of pretty much all of our good hands nines plus our good suited
Broadways our good suited ASX you see we're just choosing our good better and best hands when we're for betting from
out of position all right final pre- flop hand here so make sure you get this one right folds around to us on the
button we open with pocket Jacks to $20 a good rig in the small blind three bets to 80 it is back to us and in this
situation do we fold call or forb bet to
[Music] $180 in this situation 200 big blinds
deep I would just be calling when our opponent three bets out of the small blind when we are in position after our
opponent three bets we just want to be for betting polar we don't want to be for betting linear when we are in
position against a capable opponent because what's going to happen when we for bet well our opponent from out of
position isn't going to be doing nearly as much calling as they would from in position our opponent is just going to jam a lot they're just going to fold a
lot when our opponents aren't going to be doing a lot of calling we want to be playing a more polarized range and Jax
is kind of a little bit in between there here's a pretty close approximation of how I would play my range button versus
small blind when the small blind three bets you see we're four betting the very very top of our range Kings Aces Ace
King suited and then sometimes queens and Ace King and then we get in there with some forb Bluffs the ace 8 ace7
ace6 king9 suited 87 suited stuff like that mainly coming from the ax and kingx
hands kind of blocking our opponent having the top of the range you see the whole middle of our range just calls
Jacks 10 nines Queen Jack suited king queen suited all the middle of our Reigns now is just calling because we
don't really have incentive to put in another bet we want to be doing a lot of calling because we're in position we are
going to have the positional advantage and if we forbet here we're just assuming that our opponent's probably
not doing a ton of calling when they are out of position we want to be doing quite a bit of calling which means we're not going to be going linear so we will
be going polar in this particular scenario all right so wrapping up pre flap that was seven questions is that
seven yes I think that is seven we are now moving on to the flap so keep track of your score all right still unless
otherwise noted we're playing 2 five 200 big blinds effective so this one we're going to open on the button with pocket 9es villain's going to call in the big
blind flop comes Jack n Deuce what do you know and our opponent checks it over
to us so in this situation here on the Flop should we check bet $20 or bet
$40 in this situation as a pre- flop Razer I would almost always be choosing the $20 size because I want to choose a
size where our opponent is going to raise their strong stuff and still call with their weak stuff now if we go $20
when the board is this wet and dynamic if our opponent does have a super strong hand like pocket Deuces Jack n of Hearts
right if they have a super strong hand they're going to put in more money for us they'll check raise to $60 or $80 and we'll get that big betat from the strong
portion of their range and by choosing this very small size we also get value from the parts of the range that are essentially drawing dead here hands like
pocket sixes pocket fives Ace Queen Ace 10 hands like that that would just never
call if we pted it so by choosing this smaller size we get value from the stronger portions of the range so we'll put in more money for us and we get
value from the weak parts of their range so I would go with the $20 bet all right next hand here we open pocket eight from
the cutof villain's going to call on the button and the Flop comes Queen 84 so we flop middle set here and in this
situation against the typical live opponent should we check bet $20 or bet
$40 against the typical live poker player in the spot they are going to overstep particularly because this board
is wet and dynamic and they're going to Telegraph their hand strength with their bed sizing I would just be checking my
entire range here all right so this one is a two-part question so that was part one now part two we check it over to our
opponent and now our opponent bets $40 pretty big stab with pocket eight here
should we call raised to 150 or raised to
[Music] 300 so in this spot I would raise to 300
when our opponent stabed $40 on this board they are just saying hey I really like my hand that means we don't have
much fold Equity so I think our opponents are just going to be pretty inelastic here if they have hands like
Ace Queen if they have hands like acex of Hearts if they have hands like Jack 10 or 109 or 4X of Hearts I think with
most of our opponent's range that stabs the size remember against Live players they're not going to be balanced when they choose a big size particularly on a
wet Dynamic board it just means they have good hands that they aren't planning on folding so let's just Pile in a lot of money money right now and
then we can play a two Street game I think it would be a pretty big mistake here to check raise the typical 3 or 4X
SI when our opponent is telegraphing they're screaming from the top of the roofs hey I love my hand so we beat
almost every single hand that they love why would we put in a small check rise let's just Pile in money and try to play for stacks on the turn all right next
hand here a multi-way spot so we're going to open with pocket Queens the cut off the button small blind and big blind
are all going to call now it's going to check around to us here on a jack n
Deuce flop in this particular situation should we check bet $30 or bet
[Music] $80 in this spot I would actually be
betting and I choose the $30 size my reason for betting is I don't think this board is very very likely to get stabbed
now if we were heads up with one player in position I think it's very likely to get stabbed because players just monkey stabb when they have pocket sixes or 9x
or pocket 8s or whatever but when there's just one player in position behind us and the pot is four ways
players just don't monkey stab nearly as much when the pot is four ways and there's only one player in position to
us so I just don't think this flop is likely to get stabbed now why would I go $30 instead of 80 well I'd still like to
choose the size here that our opponents are going to be enticed to call with their weak stuff and raise their strong stuff and when it's multi-way sometimes
we have to choose a smaller size maybe less than half pot maybe closer to one/ thir pot because our opponents are a
little bit less likely to fast play their strong stuff particularly if they're next to act like the button or the small B blind here when there's
players left behind them they're less likely to fast play and they're less likely to call with their weak stuff when there's other players left behind
them so I would just size down when I am multi-way to ensure that both of those things still occur at a high frequency
all right next flop spot we open with pocket sevens on the button villain in the big blind is going to call and flop comes ace7 deuce in this particular spot
should we check back bet $20 or bet
$60 so here I'd be betting $60 i' actually go with the overb on this board
these are the boards I deviate these static kind of ace high boards because if we choose a $20 bet here our opponent
is probably not going to raise their strong stuff or call with a restu the board is dry it is static if our
opponent has a hand like pocket Deuces or a do suited they are much more likely to slow play When the board is this
static and dry and on top of that if our opponent just has weak stuff like King Jack or pocket sixes or pocket fours or
something like that even if we choose a small size on this a high board our opponent doesn't really put us on many draws they always put us on a hand like
Ace King they're probably not going to float with their weak stuff they're probably not going to raise their strong stuff at nearly a high enough frequency
so on this board I just generally choose an overb or check strategy in the overb size I'm just choosing my very very good
hands my massive draws which we don't have any draws on this board or our hands with very good blocking properties
blocking our opponent having super strong hands like sets or two pair in this particular spot with pocket sevens
I just want to Pile in money I don't think our opponent is ever folding an ace here and I'd like to m maximize
value against the ASX portion of the range which is going to be in elastic at least on the flop for at next flop spot
we open pocket 9es in the cutoff and the villain on the button calls notice in this hand we're starting off a little
bit shorter we are only 400 effective to start this hand here and the Flop comes
ace9 Deuce rainbow so we flop middle set here and in this situation should we
check bet $25 or bet $50
in this spot I'd actually just come out and bet $50 here so why would I just come out and bet 50 number one the board
type and board texture these static dry boards are the boards that are least likely to be stabbed compared to the wet
Dynamic boards like Jack n dece with a flush draw so our opponent's still going to over stab relative to equilibrium but they're just not going to over stab
nearly as much as it would on a wet Dynamic Board number two the biggest thing here is the stack depth right our opponent only starts his hand 400
effective and we just don't need to go for a check raise to Pile in all the money right we're not really worried
about bad turn in River cards we're not really worried about a flush coming in where our opponent would fold top pair
or something like that we're not really worried about maximizing value from their big draws right we could just go bet bet bet and very easily get the
money in and the best way to minimize fold Equity is just to bet ourselves instead of going for a check raise the reason we go for check raises is because
we often want to play a two- Street game and Pile in money before the nuts change but on this board we don't really have to worry about that we can just go bet
flop bet turn bet River very easily get the money in with reasonable turn in River sizes and we don't need to go for that check raise in order to accomplish
that goal next in here we open Jack 10 of spades on the button villain and the big blind is going to call and flop comes ace8 Deuce with a couple of Spades
and when our opponent checks it over to us should we check back bet $20 or bet
$60 so here I would actually be checking back and let me explain why on these ace
high static boards I'm playing an overb or check strategy the hands that I'm using for the overbet are my very very
strong hands maybe Ace King plus my two pair my sets those would be my over bets for value and the hands that I want to
use as my overb Bluffs either my massive massive draws where if they check raise I have a very easy decision to call and
they are hands with very good blocking properties maybe a hand like king deuce of diamonds blocking our opponent having pocket Deuces Ace Duce suited so I'd
want to choose the hands where if we get check raised here we have a very easy decision just a very easy fold or a very easy call this hand if we get check
raised after we overb we are kind of in a pickle right cuz we could be up against two pair or sets which I guess
we're doing okay against but we also could just be up against asex of Spades so this hand for me when we're playing
this over better check strategy would just work better as a check back here and on this board my over bets would be
maybe some ax of Spades hands and then my Ace King plus two pair sets and maybe some Deuce xand blocking my opponent
having those two pair and sets next hand we open pocket sevens in the cut off our opponent calls on the button notice
we're starting this hand 500 effective so only a 100 big blinds to start this hand and now the Flop coms 1075 we flop
middle set so in this spot should we check bet $20 or bet
$50 so in this spot I would actually be checking and this spot's different from the ace9 de spot earlier where our
opponent was shallow when we flop middle set where we could just go bet bet bet because this board is wet and dynamic this board's going to get stabbed a lot
more often than the ace9 deuce rainbow example and because the board is wet and dynamic by checking here it just us the
option to possibly play a one or two Street game if our opponent stabs before a straightening card or a flushing card
or something like that comes in that would kind of force our opponent to fold their good hands so I would check all
right two-part question we do check and now our opponent stabs for $20 so a small size here on a wet Dynamic board
so when our opponent stabs small with middle set should we call raised to $80 or raised to150
this one is a little bit tricky I would actually still raise the big size to 150
here and you may be thinking well Mark when our opponent stabs small don't they just have a weaker range well yes they
do our opponent just doesn't have as much strong 10x or pocket fives or super strong hands on this board when they
choose a small size but the thing is if our opponent's just monkey stabbing with a hand like pocket sixes or pocket
eights or ace4 of Spades right if we check race to any size they're going to fold those hands and when our opponent
stabs small it doesn't doesn't always mean that they have a weak hand it just means that their range is a little bit weaker might our opponent sometimes stab
small if they have a hand like 89 here or 68 or a king high club draw even an
ace high club draw just because our opponent stabs small we can probably chop off a lot of their pocket fives
their Ace 10 King 10 stuff like that but they could still have draws when they take the small size that are going to be
in elastic and by choosing this big size here it allows us just to play a really
clean two- Street game where we can just Jam most turns get the money in and play for Stacks against our opponent's
stronger draws that are just going to be in elastic and not want to fold all right next hand another multi-way spot
in this one the lowjack limps and we're going to ISO on the button to $30 now the small blind big blind and the limper
come along jack9 Deuce what do you know we flop middle pair here it checks around to us on the button and in this
spot should we check back bet $40 or bet $120
so here multi-way I would almost always be checking back when we are multi-way it is just much more likely we are up
against a strong hand somewhere if this pot was heads up right I would just be betting my entire range because our
opponents are going to play poorly against a range bet but when we have three four five players in the pot we need to be a little bit more picky about
our SE betting and I'm just going to be C betting our thick value and our very strong draws here in the spot kind of
our Equity driven portion of our range when we have three other players in the pot Ace 9 does not fall into into that
category kind of a showdown value we hand when we are four ways here so I would just be checking back and seeing
what transpires on the turn all right the final hand of the Flop part of the poker test here so in this hand we have
King five of diamonds we open up the button villain's going to defend in the big blind flop comes Ace 95 and in this
particular spot should we check back bet $20 or bet
$60 so once again on these ace high kind of static boards I am playing an overb or check strategy when we are 200 big
blinds deep this is the perfect hand to put into our overb Bluff size here on the flop because on these boards our
opponents just aren't going to fast play pocket fives Ace five suited pocket 9es nearly as much when we have a hand like
King five makes it way less likely our opponent has fives or Ace five and also makes it less likely our opponent has Ace King which live opponents will
sometimes flat particularly from out of position pre flop so this hand just has some really nice blocking properties
don't like to go too overboard with the blockers because I think they're misapplied and people just rely on them too much in poker where it really
doesn't matter but this is one of the spots where our opponent just won't really fast play their strong St where having those blocking properties is
really nice so I would just start off with an overb here on the Flop targeting our opponent's acex that's always going to call the Flop Call the turn and then
fold the river think we can get a lot of folds from hands like Ace 4 Ace 10 even like Ace Jack here if we go big bet big
bet jam on this board just really hard for our opponent to put us on draws and having that King in our hand having that five in our hand really nice candidate
to run that bluff all right so now we are done with the Flop that was nine questions now we're we're going to move
on to the turn seven turn questions coming right up all right so first hand here on the turn we open 7 six of
diamonds on the button our opponent calls in the big blind queen 84 we are just going to be range betting here choosing the size where our opponents
raise their strong stuff call with their weak stuff we go 20 our opponent calls go to a turn which is an offit deuce and when our opponent checks it over to us
on the turn here do we check this one back bet $30 or bet
$120 so on this turn I would be choosing the $120 sizing because I think our opponent is capped but they still have
some inelastic hands in the range so when we bet small on the Flop and when our opponent just calls they're generally going to raise off their
pocket eights Queen eight suited pocket fours on the Flop so the best hands they have getting to this turn are going to be a lot of one pair hands like Ace
queen king queen but it doesn't mean those hands are going to be folding right now so I would choose this very large size here on the turn because even
though our opponent is capped they don't have the strong stuff that's going to put in more money for us but it doesn't mean they're fold now so with our Bluffs
here on this turn we want to be piling in as much money as possible just because they are in elastic on the turn does not mean they're going to be in
elastic on the River on a lot of rivers if they break all their flush draws and straight draws fold and the queen x on a
lot of rivers is really going to start getting squeamish and not want to play for all the money when we start 200 big
blinds effective so on this turn I would be over betting next hand we open Ace five of Hearts from the cut off button
calls flop comes 85 deuce and in this spot on a wet Dynamic board I'm just
checking my entire range at at this stack depth to a typical live player so we check our opponent goes 30 we've got
middle pair with top kicker here so even to a big stab I'd probably be calling
here because yes when our opponent chooses to size they have a little bit of a stronger range but we got middle pair we can approve so we're going to
call we go to a turn which is a four here and so we pick up a gutter to go along with middle pair we check it over
to our opponent and now our opponent goes 80 into 107 on this turn do we fold
call or check raise to 200
$40 so on this spot I would just be folding even though we do pick up some Equity here I think in this spot we are
drawing pretty pretty thin first of all we have a couple clues here number one our opponent chose a big size on the
Flop live opponents in particular tend to under double barrel massively right they over stab on the Flop and then they
under double barrel turns and under triple barrel Rivers he is just screaming he really really likes makes
his hand Live players are just going to be massively under bluffing here and even though we pick up Equity I'd say
we're drawing very very thin we are almost always behind in the spot so I would just pitch this card into the muck
and give up right now next hand on the turn we open Ace Queen of Diamonds on the button villain's going to call in the big blind flop comes 983 I'm just
choosing the size on this wet Dynamic board where our opponents call with their weak stuff raise or strong stuff usually around half pot here so I go 20
and our opponent calls we go to a turn which is a four of diamonds giving us a nuts and when our opponent checks over
to us in this spot should we check back bet $30 or bet
$120 so here I'd be choosing the small size the $30 size and the reason why is
because on this turn our opponent is once again uncapped most live opponents play flaps way too passively they under
check R particularly with their draws and semi Bluffs so getting to this turn our opponent is going to have quite a
lot of flushes himself and the really nice part of betting 30 here when we get to this turn is our opponent is going to
put in more money for us they're going to check raise when they have a king High 10 High Jack High flush here on
this turn and also by betting 30 our opponent is now going to continue with a bunch of hands that we have drawing dead
by choosing this small size here on the turn we incentivize our opponents to raise with their strong stuff which they
have because the nuts have changed on this turn and we incentivize them to continue with their weak stuff that we
have drawing dead next hand here we open pocket fors opponent calls on the button flop comes 74 dece so we flop middle set
again on a wet Dynamic board I'm just checking my entire range out of position to the typical live opponent so we check
our opponent goes $30 and our opponent chooses a pretty big size on this board 60% plus pot here just assuming that
they've got a pretty strong range that they just don't want to fold many of those hands so we're going to put in the big boy check raise we go $300 here our
opponent calls now the turn is a seven giving us a boat here and on this turn should we check bet $200 or Jam all in
for $680
so I'd actually go for the very small size here $200 and my reasoning behind this is I really don't want our
opponents to fold a hand like acex of clubs that we have drawing dead and also by betting $200 if our opponent does
have a seven they'll probably just put the money in for us and if they do have an over pair a hand like eights NES 10 Jacks for this $200 size they're just
not going to fold when the board pairs if we Jam all in here if we choose a big size our opponent will just start
folding the hands that we have drawing dead they're opening straight draws or flush draws which is a disaster for us they may call they may fold with their
over pairs it's a mix but if we go 200 they just always call with their over pairs in my opinion why not check here
in the spot I think when we check raise a flop particularly for a large size if we check it over to our opponents
they're probably just going to check back and realize with their flush draws with their straight draws sometimes even their over pairs here they're going to
be pretty cautious about stabbing after we take that huge check rice size on the Flop so I think the best way to get
value here is to choose a very very small size here on the turn they'll put the money in for us when they have trips and they'll continue with their draws we
have dra dead and all their over pairs that we have drawing very very thin next hand we open Ace King of Hearts on the
button our opponent calls in the big blind flop comes King 93 just going with the half pot size here on the Flop where
they raise the strong stuff call their weak stuff and our opponent actually puts in a raise here we've got top pair
we're beating some of our opponent's draws but we're drawing pretty pretty thinly against their two pair and their sets so I am just going to call here see
what transpires on the turn the turn is a pretty good card for us Deuce of Hearts giving us the nuts and now our opponent checks so in this spot once our
opponent has checked raise the Flop and now checked the turn to us and we have the nuts should we check back bet $70 or
bet
$250 so in this spot I'd actually be going for the very very big size $250 and here's why our opponent is
capped in the spot I do not believe that they have flushes opponents are going to be more passive with their flesh draws
they don't just raise off their flush draws willy-nilly they tend to play those a little bit too passively what type of player will raise flesh draws on
the flap more aggressive players when the flesh gets there on the turn is an aggressive player now the type of player
who's going to slow down and check when they get there probably not so we can just rule out flushes now could they
have a flush at a very small frequency okay sure but the majority of their range both from aggressive players and
passive players when they check raise a flop and then check the turn when the flush comes in is going to be hands like two pair in sets hands like pocket NES
pocket 3es king n suited so even if we choose a small size here those hands are just never raising in a million years
they're kind of checking for hot control they're afraid of the flush when we call the check raise on the Flop and now the flush comes in on the turn so in this
spot our opponent is capped but they are also in elastic they're just not folding even though they checked here I be going
with the big size here we want to set up less than a 1 spr on the river if possible so that way it's going to be
really hard for our opponent to get away from their sets Pile in the money now when they are not putting in more money
for us next hand we open 8 seven of Spades from the cut off button calls flop comes 1073 wet Dynamic flop just
checking my entire range we check and our opponent stabs small here so we've got middle pair no real reason to turn
this hand into a bluff we've got sufficient Showdown value against our opponent's range of stabs small here on the Flop so we are going to call now the
turn is a seven so we make trips here on this turn after our opponent stabs small
so on this turn planning ahead are we going to go for a check call a Check raise or should we just lead ourselves
for $80 so on this turn I would actually
just lead and reason why I would lead has a lot to do with our opponent's stab size on the Flop when our opponent
chooses a $20 stab a small stab on the Flop on a wet Dynamic board their range is just going to be weak live opponents
don't value bet thinly enough and they don't double barrel as a bluff nearly enough so if our opponent has a hand
like 89 for a straight draw has a hand like a king High Jack High flush draw a lot of the time here after they stab on
the Flop they'll just check back and try to realize and when they choose that small size it's just not going to consist of a lot of 10x it's going to be
weaker hands maybe some draws maybe some hands like pocket eights pocket n stuff like that so I would just come out and
Lead here because I'm not expecting our opponent to double barrel at a high frequency and when we lead we're going to minimize fold Equity I don't expect
our opponent to fold hands like flush draws or straight draws when we check call and come out in lead on the turn here and I don't expect our opponent to
fold hands like pocket eights or pocket nines for one bet when we just come out and lead on the turn now if our opponent
stab big on the Flop I'd probably be checking again going for that big boy check raise against the strong portion
of of their range but when they stay up small their range is weaker so I would just put the money in for them next hand we open on the button with King Nine of
Spades opponent calls in the big blind flop comes King 93 so we flop two pair this time we are going to CED half pot
size with a razor strong stuff called the rest stuff now our opponent puts in a check raise here we are going to just
call and the turn is a nine giving us top Full House now and now our opponent
checks it over to us should we check back bet $70 or bet $250
so this is a little bit different when we made the flush on the turn before and I would actually go small here I would go $70 so let's think about our
opponent's range here when they check raise the Flop and check the turn when the board pairs this is a lot different than when the flush comes in first of
all our opponents don't check raise fles draws nearly enough second of all they check raise their value they're two pair in their sets way too often so our
opponent's range is just weighted towards two pair in sets to check raise the Flop getting to this turn they're just going to have pocket 3 is a whole
hell of a lot why might they check pocket fre well because now their hand is invulnerable they have nothing to fear they don't have to worry about
flush draws straight draws bad cards coming in when our opponents feel invulnerable that's sometimes when they trap that's sometimes when they slow
play so they could have a hand like pocket threes also could just have some of the draws here yes our opponents don't check raise the draws enough but
they could have King X of Hearts Jack 10 Queen 10 Queen Jack of Hearts right so they could have some combo draws here so
in a spot our opponent's actually uncapped they can have pocket threes a high percentage of the time and also when the board pairs we don't want to
choose that huge size and get our opponents to full old hands that we have drawing dead or drawing very very thin
like King X of hearts or their combo draws so we want to choose a small size here to entice those hands to call and
if they have pocket threes well we're going to get in all the money against that hand anyway we don't really have to go with a big bet cuz either our
opponent's going to just check raise and put in more money for us now or they'll just lead the river or check raise the river we're going to get in all the money if our opponent has a boat so
let's make sure we maximize value against our opponent's draws which are going to be elastic here on this turn
when the board pairs see how differently this spot is than when the flush comes in on the turn all right so that was
seven questions on the turn we're moving on to the river we're going to have seven questions with two bonuses for a
total of nine points on the river so hopefully you're keeping track let's move on to the final part of the test the river all right first River question
we open pocket fives big blind calls going to choose the size where they raise strong stuff call with their weak stuff on the Flop so we go 20 our
opponent calls we go to a turn and our opponent is capped but they're going to have some inelastic hands they're going to have hands like acex of diamonds Ace
Queen 4X of diamonds hands it just aren't folding even for a big size although they're never going to put in more money for us we're going to choose
the big size here on this turn we go to a river which is a queen giving us a full house now pot is 322 we've got $
840 behind on this River so should we bet $200 $350 or go with the all-in
overb size
$840 on this River I would just be jamming going $840 the all-in big boy size for Value
because I think most of our opponent's range getting to this river is either going to be bricked draws or queen X if
I had a bluff in this spot if I had a hand like seven six of Spades I would feel very very uncomfortable going all
in for all the money I just don't think our opponents are folding Queen X ever so that means when we have value in this
spot we don't think our opponents are ever going to fold trips so I would just go all in with pocket fivs next hand a solid rag opens on the button we're
going to defend in the big blind with Ace Jack flop comes King Jack for we flop middle pair our opponent bets 20 we're going to call turn is now a six of
diamonds our opponent goes with a pot siiz bet and we're going to call once again with middle pair now we get to the river we're going to check and our
opponent goes 180 into 242 on this River so once again we are playing against a
solid rag who triple Barrels in a spot so should we fold call or raise all
in so on this River against a rag against a pro I would actually be
calling here on this River Rags are going to be much more capable of bluffing than fish or wrecks
particularly in wide configurations right we've got button versus big blind that's about as wide as it gets on
double Broadway boards because they're just going to see bet the range on the flops they're going to have too many hands getting to the turn there's a lot
of natural Bluffs in there right the queen 10 the 109 the ace 10 so rags in
general going to overbluff wide configurations double Broadway boards single raise pots where we give them
rope and when all the money doesn't go in on the river right all the money doesn't go in still a reasonable size on this River not all that scary so this is
a spot where I think live Rags or good players could be over bluffing so I'm just going to get a little bit sticky
here and call with our Bluff catcher next hand we open 76 of Spades villain calls in the big blind King 95 we're
just see betting half pot our opponent calls we get to this turn our opponent is capped here but they're going to have in elastic hands so we are going to
overb our opponent puts in the call get to the river which is an offsuit Deuce our opponent checks it over and on this
River should we check back bet $200 or Allin $840
and on this River I would just be going all in with the big boy overbet Bluff size I would ask myself in this question
if I did have a hand like pocket aces or Ace King well I'd be targeting hands like king queen king Jack King 10 I
don't think our opponent is going to call a 2.5x 3X pot over bet on this River if they have a hand like King Jack or King 10 so with value here I'd
probably be going in the vicinity of 350 400 if we're a little greedy here what
does that mean when we're BL if we think our opponent is folding King Jack king queen king 10 if we just put the money in here a high percentage of the time
but we have a very very very profitable all-in Bluff spot we see here this a little bit different from the hand we
saw before where there was a board pairing card on the river giving our opponent a lot of trips our opponent's just not really going to have hands better than one pair here at a high
frequency so we're just going to put in all the money and go for the range fold next hand we are playing against a 25
rag again in this one we open red Aces our opponent is going to call in the big blind Jack 7 Deuce we just see bet small
here our opponent puts in a shck rays and maybe he could be doing this with worse for Value some Bluffs here some gut shot so we are going to call turn is
a four of hearts and now our opponent chooses a relatively small size 100 into 162 can still have the best hand here
some of the time our opponent could also still have some of those straight draws maybe some hands that picked up a back door to go along with it 10 n of Hearts
8 n of Hearts 108 of Hearts stuff like that so we are going to call once again now the river is the 10 of hearts and
our opponent comes out and Bets 160 here on this River should we fold call or
raise all in on this River I would be raising all
in when our opponent chooses this size on the river I think they are running out of Bluffs right we talked about
those hands that check raise the Flop and then double barrel the turn it's just going to be a lot of those like gut shots or straight draws or back door
flush draws the flush gets there on the river the gut shots either make a pair or get there on the river our opponent
in this spot is just really not bluffing I think we can rule out calling right away and holding seems like a reasonable
option but let's consider this for one second if our opponent did have a hand like Jack X of Hearts is this a line
they would take well probably not maybe the king Jack of Hearts Queen Jack of Hearts those hands just get three bet
pre- flop at some frequency from a solid Rag and they don't really get check raised all that much on the flop in the
first place also if our opponent did have a hand like 8 nine of Hearts is he going to check raise the Flop all the
time probably not is it going to double barrel the turn after he check raises the Flop when he picks up Equity well yeah sure probably but is this a size at
89 kind of Hearts is going to use on the river or might it get a little bit greedier so I just think when our
opponent chooses this size even Rags even live Pros are going to be unbalanced here when they back into a
back door flush they're generally just going to choose a bigger size and they just don't really have any Bluffs to take this line so most of our opponent's
range is going to be hands like pocket sevens pocket Deuces Jack seven suited
and against a rag remember this is not a fish against a rag how is a rag going to be feeling we call a Check raise on the
Flop we call his turn Barrel the flush and the straight gets there on the river now he bets and now we Jam over the top
we just look so strong here if I put myself in that rake shoes I would fold pocket s pocket Deuces Jack seven all
the time and we just don't think our opponent has a flush we don't think our opponent has a straight all that often
on this River so if we think we can get our opponent to fold sevens and Deuces here all the time I would just be turning our Bluff catcher into a bluff
for the most profitable play on this River now bonus question let's say we get to this River in the same way with a
hand like Ace Jack of Hearts right so our opponent check raise the Flop Barrel the turn and now bets on the river what
should we do with Ace Jack of Hearts should we raise to $350 raise to $600 or
raiseed to
820 so I'd be raising small I'd be raising to 350 I think we can rule out the 820 right away that's the size we
were going to choose as a bluff I think if we raise to 820 our opponent just folds hands like sevens and Deuces and Jack 7 all the time right that's why the
bluff was so good so we want to ensure that our opponent's going to call with those hands so in the spot very hard for
us to be bluffing from an aware players perspective so I would just choose a very very small size give them a good
price and hope they get curious with a hand like pocket sevens pocket's Jack seven for a very good price if we just
click this to 350 on this River all right next we have Ace Queen of Spades on the button opponent calls in the big
blind queen for Deuce with a couple Spades pretty good flop for us we're just going to see bet half pot opponent calls turn is a six on this turn our
opponent is uncapped so we're going to choose a small size get them to raise off their flushes get them to call with their weak stuff that we have drawing
dead so we go small and our opponent just calls we go to a river which is the innocuous eight of diamonds our opponent
checks it over to us once again do we bet $100 $250 or
$420 so here I'd be going with a small size $100 because I think our opponent
is capped and their range is going to be quite elastic remember we bet small on the Flop where opponent would raise
their fours their Deuces their four dece suited Queen four suited at a high frequency then we bet small in the turn
where opponents would raise their flushes at a high frequency now getting to this River most of our opponents range is going to be weak right it's
going to be Queen X Type hands maybe a hand like pocket nines with a spade our opponent's range is going to be weak so
if we want our opponent to call we can't just Pile in money just because we have a good hand if we want to make more
money we need to choose a reasonable size taking into account our opponent's range on this River so if I'm trying to get a hand like Queen Jack king queen
something like that to call on this River the flush has gotten there the obvious draw has gotten there I believe we need to size down here I would just
go $100 trying to get king queen queen Jack Queen 10 to call here on this River
second to last hand this one we have Ace Jack of clubs a recreational player three bets on the button this is a wreck
not a rig we are going to call ace9 Duce we check it over our opponent bets big here on this flap but we've got top pair
we're calling now on the turn there is a back door flush draw to go along with a front door flush draw our opponent double barrels well there's lots of
draws out there so let's see what transpires we're going to call once again with top pair we get to the river which is a deuce pairing the board we
check it over our opponent bets $600 all in on this River options here in this spot do we fold call or take our pants
off swing them around our head and roll around on the table
pantsless while the pants option is tempting I would actually fold in the spot lots of context clues here number
one our opponent three bet they chose a big size on the flap when our opponent
chooses the big size they're just going to have a stronger range they double barreled on the turn our opponents under
double barrel in live poker particularly as a bluff now on this River they are putting in a big chunky bet here on the
river 600 into 800 opponent under triple barrel we don't beat any value Ace High boards are under bluffed it's a big size
for the game so because our opponent is under bluffing and our hand does not beat value our hand is just a bluff Catcher And if our opponent is under
bluffing every Bluff catcher is more profitable as a fold than as a call final hand here this one our opponent
opens in the cut off to 20 we're going to three bet on the button with seven six of hearts and and our opponent a live recreational player is going to
call flop com's 94 deuce in a three bet pot just range betting just like I would in a single race pot but choosing a
smaller size because the absolute size of the pot is bigger so want to choose a smaller size to entice our opponent to call with the weak stuff raise or strong
stuff so I go 50 here our opponent calls turn is a king and when our opponent checks it over I'm going to choose a
small size here on this turn because I would hate for our opponent to fold hands like pocket 10 pocket Jacks pocket
Queens hands like 9x and if we start going too big our opponent's range getting to the river is just going to be
hands like Ace King the occasional slow played set and maybe a big combo draw like Ace three or Ace five of Spades by
going too big on this turn we just funnel our opponent to the river with a very very strong range we'd like to keep
in a lot of the weaker hands to make our River bluffing range more profitable so we are going to go small on this turn
our opponent calls we get to a river which is an Ace and now our opponent checks it over so our options on this River are going to be to check back to
bet $120 for a small Bluff or to bet $810 for the big boy Bluff
I would actually be choosing the small size here on this River $120 we funneled our opponent to the river with a weak
range and it's not going to take that much money here to get our opponents to fold hands like pocket 10 pocket Queens
on this acex River our opponent's going to be very elastic with a lot of those hands that we allowed to get to the
river in this way so we can just get a very cheap price on our Bluff here no real reason to go all in and isolate
oursel against a part of our opponent's range it's just ace King Ace 9 suited ace four of Spades right no reason to
choose the big size let's be efficient just get those hands like tens Jack Queens to fold here bonus and final question now in this River we get here
with pocket kings and our opponent checks it over now our options with pocket kings are to either bet $120 $400
for just over the size of the pot or all in for [Music]
$810 and with pocket kings on this River I would be going all in why would I be going all in because I think our
opponent just has some very strong hands that are just never folding hands like ace four of Spates Ace deu of Spades Ace
9 suited maybe even a hand like Ace King I think our opponent's range getting to this river is just going to have some
brick walls I would just like to maximize value against that portion of our opponent's range now our opponent just never call in in a million years no
matter what size we choose if they have a hand like 9x 10's Jack Queens so let's just maximize the value against the top
of our opponent's range now there may be a case for sizing down targeting the ASX of Spades but I think the asex of Spades
may call a jam sometimes anyway but I think our opponent's going to have a ton of two pair in the range I think those hands are never folding I think the ASX
of Spades maybe sometimes gets curious and calls a jam some percentage of the time I would be going all in with pocket kings all right so let's add up your
points here if you got somewhere between 30 to 34 you are a Crusher an end boss 24 to 29 solid rig pretty good winning
player for sure 18 to 23 trying recreational player you're trying maybe break even maybe a small winner but
you're getting there and somewhere between 10 to 17 smells a little bit fishy and if you got 0o to N9 we're
talking about a beluga a massive whale maybe need to go back and work on some
of this poker stuff all right guys hopefully you enjoyed this poker IQ test and it turns you into the biggest boy possible thank you and have a gentle day
