The most common bet size in poker is
0:02
also the worst. Let me tell you about
0:04
Alex, one of our early students. He was
0:06
struggling and making about $35 an hour
0:08
until we banned him from using any
0:11
normal bet size between 1/3 to full pot
0:14
on any turn in river. After a month, his
0:17
win rate doubled. And over the next
0:19
year, he had his first six figure year
0:21
playing poker. Today, I'll show you the
0:23
nine spots where medium bet sizes kill
0:24
your win rate and also the four rare
0:27
exceptions to the rule. If you're still
0:29
defaulting to half pot, you are leaving
0:31
piles of money on the table. All right,
0:34
so the first example here is going to be
0:35
as the pre flop razer facing a large
0:37
stab on the flop. So we're going to open
0:39
in the cutoff button calls. Flop comes
0:41
jack 98. And as you guys are probably
0:43
familiar with, I'm a big fan of doing a
0:44
lot of checking out of position because
0:45
live players tend to overstab and
0:47
telegraph their hand strength with their
0:48
size. We check here and now our opponent
0:50
goes with the big boy size for $50 here.
0:53
And I see a lot of players in this spot.
0:55
They do put in the check raise, which is
0:57
good. It's better than just calling
0:58
here. But so many players here, they
1:00
will just check raise as a default to 3x
1:02
or 4x going 150 or 200 in this spot.
1:05
Let's talk about why I think using this
1:07
medium check race size is such a huge
1:09
mistake. So, let's pull up the
1:10
handydandy solver. We've given our
1:11
opponent the option to choose three
1:13
actions here. Either a big bet for 50
1:15
bucks, a small bet for 25 bucks, or a
1:17
check back. And if we plug in here just
1:19
the part of our opponent's range that is
1:20
top pair, two pair, sets, and straits.
1:23
Essentially top pair less. Here we see
1:25
our opponent is choosing this big size
1:26
about 21% of the time, the small size
1:28
about 24% of the time, and they check
1:30
back 55% of the time. That means in
1:32
equilibrium, when our opponent has top
1:33
pair plus, they're choosing a small size
1:35
or checking back nearly 80% of the time
1:37
on this board. Is that a reality in live
1:40
poker? All right. Instead, let's adjust
1:41
this conservatively. Let's say when our
1:42
opponent has top pair plus, they bet big
1:44
half the time. They bet small 25%. They
1:46
check back 25%. I still think this is
1:48
conservative. I would say when our
1:50
opponents just have a good hand on a wet
1:51
dynamic board, they probably just bet
1:52
big 70 80% of the time, but we'll give
1:55
them a little bit of credit here. But we
1:56
still see here when our opponent bets
1:57
50, when they bet big, we're still using
1:59
this large check race size to 6x to 300
2:02
bucks. Never. The solver doesn't use
2:04
this size. Here's why. When we check
2:06
race to 300 here, the solver actually
2:08
folds two pair, top pair, and fluster
2:10
65% of the time to this big check raise.
2:12
Because our opponent's range is so
2:14
strong when they choose this big staff,
2:16
they're supposed to make some huge folds
2:18
when we check race to 6x. Do we think
2:19
this happens? No. What if our opponent
2:21
instead folds top pair, two pair, and
2:23
flush draws only 40% of the time or 45%
2:26
of the time? So, we just bump this down
2:28
slightly. They're still making some big
2:29
folds. They're still folding top pair
2:31
quite a bit, but they're just not
2:32
folding their combo draws or their ace
2:33
high flush draws or two pairs. So, we
2:35
just adjust this slightly. And would you
2:36
look at that sweet baby there. Now, the
2:38
solver can get behind this $300 big boy
2:41
raise on the flop. Zooming out here, the
2:43
reason why it's a punt to make a small
2:45
raise when our opponent stabs big is
2:47
because live players are going to be
2:48
unbalanced. And when they stab big,
2:50
their range is just too strong. Let me
2:52
ask you, when a player stabs for 50 or
2:55
60 on this board, how would you feel
2:57
about bluffing them with a low equity
2:59
draw or air? Probably not very good,
3:01
right? It would probably be a punt cuz
3:03
you're thinking, well, they're probably
3:04
not folding when they bet this big
3:05
because they have a strong hand. If we
3:07
don't feel good about making their range
3:09
fold, we are just lighting money on fire
3:11
by choosing this medium check race size
3:13
to $150 to $200, which I see so many
3:16
rags do. When your opponent tells you,
3:18
"Excuse me, I have a very strong hand
3:20
and you have a strong hand that can
3:22
cooler their strong hands, don't use a
3:23
medium size. Put in the big boy check
3:25
raise and win a lot more money." All
3:27
right, next example here. When our
3:28
opponent stabs small when we're the pre
3:30
flop razor. So, we open pocket eights.
3:32
Our opponent calls. We flop a set. We
3:34
check it over. And now our opponent
3:36
stabs for 25 here. And you may be
3:38
thinking,
3:38
"Well, Mark, when they stab big, they
3:41
just have strong hands. So, when they
3:43
stab small, don't they have weak hands?"
3:45
Yes. Pretty good thinking. So, I know
3:47
you said we don't want to use a medium
3:49
size. Don't we want to check raise small
3:50
here with pocket eights cuz our opponent
3:52
has a weak range? No, probably not. And
3:54
here's why. A couple of points. First,
3:56
just because our opponent stabs small
3:58
doesn't mean they're going to have zero
4:00
strong hands in the range. It just means
4:01
their range is going to be a little bit
4:03
weaker. Now, if our opponent is monkey
4:04
stabbing here with a hand like pocket
4:06
nines or ace jack or something like
4:08
that, if we just breathe on this check
4:10
raise, they're going to fold. If we
4:11
raise to 60 or 70, whatever, they are
4:14
folding all of these hands no matter
4:15
what. So, we're not going to get more
4:17
value against hands like pocket 9ines or
4:19
pocket sevens or whatever godforsaken
4:21
combo that they may be stabbing with
4:23
here. Now, they probably don't have a
4:24
lot of pocket sixes and they probably
4:25
don't have any pocket queens in their
4:27
range the way this hand is played out,
4:29
but they still have some draws when they
4:31
stab small. They still have some top
4:33
pair. And in general, live players are
4:35
going to be a little bit too inelastic,
4:37
meaning they're going to be a little bit
4:39
too sticky, too price insensitive, when
4:40
they do have a good hand here. So, if
4:42
our opponent does have a hand like of
4:44
clubs or 75 suited or they do end up
4:46
with a queen here that took the small
4:48
size, they are going to be inelastic.
4:50
And if they're just monkey stabbing with
4:51
a hand like pocket sevens, they're
4:52
folding no matter what. So, we may as
4:54
well go with the big boy size here
4:56
because they're going to make a ton of
4:58
mistakes versus this size. And in
4:59
general, what I found in my experience,
5:02
now this may differ for you, you may
5:04
disagree, whether we check raise to 75
5:06
or 100 here or whether we check raise to
5:08
250 or 275, opponents are generally
5:11
going to call too much. And if they're
5:13
going to call too much, use the bigger
5:15
size and punish them for calling too
5:16
much. What's going to happen here some
5:18
of the time is your opponent's going to
5:19
flip over a hand like queen nine suited
5:22
and they're going to shrug and they're
5:23
going to throw it in the muck. But you
5:25
will play many more large pots than the
5:27
players in your pool. And sometimes
5:29
you'll be surprised they will just spaz
5:31
here when they have an ace high flush
5:32
draw or when they have a hand like king
5:34
queen or queen jack and they'll either
5:36
call or put the money in. You're going
5:37
to play many less medium-sized pots
5:40
because they'll sometimes fold top pair
5:42
or sometimes fold a weak flush draw. But
5:44
you're going to play a lot more big pots
5:46
because they're going to be too
5:47
inelastic overall. They're going to make
5:48
a lot of mistakes versus this big size
5:50
even if their range is weak. The weak
5:52
range is folding even if we check very
5:53
small. So, we may as well go big and
5:55
target the hands that are going to
5:56
continue or punt to this huge size. All
5:58
right, next example where we don't want
6:00
to use this medium in between size four
6:01
bets on an ace high board. So, let me
6:04
explain. In this one, we are going to
6:06
open in the cutoff. The button is going
6:08
to three bet and we are going to four
6:10
bet with the second best hand in poker.
6:11
Flop comes ace 9 deuce. And this is a
6:14
spot where we don't want to go medium.
6:17
Actually, the size I like to choose here
6:18
is very, very small. Somewhere around
6:21
10% pot. Why do I like to go 10% pot
6:23
here? If our opponent has a hand like
6:25
kings, queens, jacks, tens, those hands
6:28
are going to be forced to continue for a
6:30
very small bet. Whereas, if we choose a
6:32
standard size here, like 1/3 pot or
6:34
something like that, even quarter pot, a
6:36
lot of those hands will fold. And if our
6:38
opponent has the last ace in their hand,
6:41
we're stacking that hand anyway. So, we
6:43
may as well try to ek out one tiny
6:45
streak against kings, queens, jacks,
6:47
tens. And if those hands call, best case
6:49
scenario, maybe they can hit a set and
6:51
we can cooler them. But at least we got
6:52
one street. So, I really, really like
6:54
this small size here when we have value.
6:57
When our opponent calls on this flop, I
6:58
like to do a lot of checking. Now,
6:59
what's our opponent going to do if they
7:01
have ace king or aceex of clubs on this
7:04
turn? Well, they are going to bet and we
7:06
can just put the money in. Once they bet
7:08
on the turn, they're going to commit
7:09
themselves and we can just stack them.
7:11
And if our opponent does check back on
7:13
the turn, what does that mean? Well,
7:14
they probably have a hand like pocket
7:15
queens or pocket jacks or something like
7:17
that. So, when we get to the river, we
7:18
just go very, very small. We choose the
7:20
size on this river that a hand like
7:22
pocket kings, queens, jacks is going to
7:24
be forced to call. and we still end up
7:26
getting two streets against the very
7:27
very weak portion of their range. This
7:29
also works out really nicely when we
7:31
have a bluff. You see, we bet this very
7:32
small size on the flop, keeping their
7:33
range wide and weak. We check on the
7:35
turn and if they stab on the turn, we
7:36
just fold here knowing that they're most
7:38
likely going to have an ace. They're not
7:39
going to monkey stab all that often on
7:41
this turn. When they have a hand like
7:42
pocket queens or pocket jacks, they're
7:44
just going to check back. So, if they do
7:45
check back, we go to the river. And
7:47
remember, we were betting 125 here when
7:49
we had aces trying to get called by a
7:50
hand like kings, queens, jacks. So, we
7:52
just go a little bit bigger than that.
7:53
Maybe 225, maybe 250. And we just get
7:55
all of the jacks, tens, kings, queens. I
7:58
don't know why I said them in that order
7:59
on this river to fold, which is very,
8:01
very nice when we are bluffing. All
8:03
right, next spot. We don't want to use
8:04
the medium bet. Three bet pot in
8:06
position as the pre flop razor. So, we
8:08
three bet jack 10 on the button here.
8:10
Our opponent calls and we flop the nuts.
8:11
You guys may have heard me talk about
8:12
this. I like to choose the size where
8:14
our opponents are going to raise their
8:15
strong stuff and call with the weak
8:17
stuff. And usually in three bet pots,
8:18
that's going to be a smaller size than
8:20
in a single race pot. Because two live
8:22
players, the absolute size of the bet
8:24
matters a lot more than the relative
8:26
size of the pot. Why do we want to go
8:28
$50 here? When we choose this small
8:31
size, our opponent is going to check
8:33
raise. When they have a hand like 98
8:35
suited, pocket 9ines, pocket eights,
8:37
queen nine, they're going to put in more
8:38
money for us when they have the top up
8:39
their range. And when they have weak
8:41
hands, maybe we could get a hand like
8:42
pocket sevens or pocket sixes with a
8:44
spade or ace8 or something like that to
8:46
continue here. If we go small where if
8:48
we go big, we would just blow these
8:50
hands off and they would fold, which is
8:52
not very good for us when we flop the
8:54
nuts. This also works nicely when we
8:55
have a bluff because when our opponent
8:57
raises, well, we just get let off the
8:59
hook very cheaply. But the really cool
9:01
thing is when our opponent calls,
9:03
especially on blank turns, our opponent
9:04
is now capped. We know with a pretty
9:06
high degree of certainty that they won't
9:07
have hands like queens, nines, eights,
9:09
jack 10, 98 suited. All of these strong
9:12
hands are going to raise quite a bit
9:13
when we choose a small size, especially
9:15
when they are out of position,
9:16
especially when the flap is wet and
9:18
dynamic. So beware of this. When players
9:21
are in position, they will fast play
9:22
less and trap more. And when the board
9:25
is dry and static, players will fast
9:27
play less and trap more. But on these
9:28
wet dynamic boards where the nuts can
9:30
change, when draws can come in, when our
9:32
opponents are out of position, this is
9:33
when they fast play a ton. and these
9:35
small bets to get them to raise their
9:36
strong stuff and call with their weak
9:38
stuff work to perfection. And one final
9:40
note, you may be thinking, well, when we
9:41
have showdown value, don't we want to
9:42
check back? And no, not necessarily. I
9:45
also like to bet with kind of my
9:47
middling thin value, showdown value
9:49
hands because it funnels our opponents
9:51
into the best line in poker, my favorite
9:53
line in poker, where I believe they make
9:54
a ton of mistakes. So, when we have a
9:55
showdown value, thin value type hand
9:57
like ace9 here, I like to see bet quite
9:59
a bit on the flop. Again, if we get
10:00
checked, we can just fold because our
10:01
opponents are under check bluffing. When
10:03
our opponents call, I like to check back
10:05
a lot of turns. What happens on the
10:06
river? Well, they floated the flop too
10:08
wide. They raised off too much of their
10:09
strong stuff when we bet small. So, they
10:10
get to the river with a wide and weak
10:11
range. What did they do with all of
10:13
those hands that brick? When we get to
10:15
the river, they come out and bet half
10:16
pot. We hero call and we are good. We
10:18
end up getting two streets against the
10:20
very weak portion of the range with the
10:21
middling kind of showdown value portion
10:23
of ours. All right, next example where I
10:25
don't like to choose a medium size is on
10:27
blank turns where our opponent is going
10:30
to be in elastic. So, we open pocket
10:32
sixes. Our opponent calls, we flop a
10:34
set. We see bet on the flop. Our
10:35
opponent calls, we go to a turn, which
10:36
is a deuce. And when our opponent checks
10:38
it over. All too often, I see players
10:40
use a size like $60 or $75 here on this
10:44
turn, and it makes me just want to go.
10:47
When our opponent check calls on this
10:49
flop on a wet dynamic board from out of
10:50
position, what is their range? It's
10:52
going to be relatively capped because
10:54
they're going to raise hands like pocket
10:55
four, 64 suited. All of these strong
10:57
hands are going to get raised quite a
10:59
bit on the flop. So, you may be
11:01
thinking, well, if they have kind of a
11:02
weak range, shouldn't we choose a small
11:04
size? And again, the answer is no. The
11:06
range is not necessarily weak. It is
11:07
just cap. What does that mean? They
11:09
don't really have the two pair and the
11:11
sets in their range, but they still have
11:12
a ton of king, queen, ace, queen, queen,
11:14
jack, ace of hearts, 75, 4x of hearts,
11:18
two sex of hearts. Are these hands
11:20
folding even for a massive size? No. So,
11:22
we are lighting money on fire by
11:24
choosing a 2/3 to 3/4 or pot size bet on
11:27
this turn. Queen X would call a lot
11:29
more. Flush draws would call a lot more.
11:31
Straight draws would call a lot more.
11:32
And by choosing this $75 or $80 size,
11:35
what we're essentially doing, there
11:37
aren't many hands that are going to call
11:39
75. They're going to fold to 125 or 150.
11:42
So, we may as well choose the big boy
11:44
size. By going 75, you're going to fold
11:46
out the pocket fives or 6x anyway. So,
11:48
you may as well go for the big boy size
11:50
here. The medium size does not get the
11:53
job done. And you may be thinking, what
11:54
about when we're bluffing on the turn?
11:55
Same [ __ ] We want to use this big size.
11:58
Why do we want to use this big size? The
11:59
more money we can get them to pile in
12:01
with our bluffs, the more profitable
12:03
that bluff is going to be on the river
12:04
when we get our opponents to fold. Now,
12:07
beware. This is a tightwire act, we need
12:09
to make sure our opponents are actually
12:11
capped, that we can't run into brick
12:13
walls. But if the strongest hand our
12:14
opponent is going to have after calling
12:16
this turn, getting to the river, is
12:17
going to be hand like queen X, and we're
12:19
going to have $800 behind in a $400 pot,
12:22
I feel pretty damn good about getting
12:23
Queen X to fold. So, let's pile in more
12:26
money now. So, we win a bigger pot later
12:28
when we get our opponent to fold. Next
12:30
example, we're going medium is silly on
12:32
a nutchanging turn card. So, let's talk
12:34
about it. We see bet on this flop with
12:36
bottom set. Our opponent calls. Now, a
12:38
nine comes on the turn. And you may be
12:40
thinking, well, what size do we want to
12:43
go here? Or at least I I hope you're
12:45
thinking that because that's what I'm
12:46
going to talk about now. Again, we don't
12:48
want to choose the medium size on this
12:49
turn. And this is a situation where I
12:51
actually like to choose a small size.
12:53
So, let's talk about what happens when
12:55
we choose this small size. If our
12:58
opponent does bank trips on this turn, a
13:00
hand like 9x, what are they going to do
13:01
when we choose a small size? They're
13:03
going to raise. So, the top of our
13:04
opponent's range puts in more money for
13:06
us. We also want to make sure that we
13:08
keep in our opponent's straight draws,
13:11
their gut shots, their flush draws, and
13:13
those draws get a little bit more
13:15
elastic, meaning they get more price
13:17
sensitive when the board pairs.
13:18
Recreational players don't like to chase
13:20
draws when the board pairs because they
13:22
think,
13:22
"I don't know if I'm going to be good or
13:24
not when I get there."
13:25
We need to choose a smaller size, making
13:27
sure those draws stick around because we
13:29
want the draws to hit their hand when we
13:31
have a super nutted hand like a full
13:33
house here. And by choosing the size,
13:35
the 9X raises, the king X sticks around,
13:37
the draws stick around, and we just win
13:39
the most amount of money against their
13:40
range. If we start choosing this medium
13:42
size, maybe $60, $70, the 9X is going to
13:45
slow play quite a bit more, not put in
13:47
more money for us, and the draws are
13:49
going to start folding, which is an
13:50
absolute disaster. All right. Next
13:52
situation where we don't want to use the
13:53
medium size is the big boy bluff on the
13:56
river. So, let me explain. We are going
13:57
to open on the button. Our opponent
13:59
calls. We see bet here. We're just
14:00
cbetting range in position. We get to a
14:02
turn, which is a nutchanging turn, which
14:04
we just talked about. On these
14:05
nutchanging turns, I like to once again
14:07
choose a small size, get our opponent to
14:09
raise their flushes, and also continue
14:11
with a bunch of weak stuff. Like if they
14:12
call here with pocket eights with a
14:13
spade, that is great for us when we have
14:15
a bluff because we have a wider, weaker
14:17
range to fold on the river. If we just
14:19
go really big on the turn, our opponent
14:20
may start trapping or slow playing with
14:22
their flushes and they'll start folding
14:24
hands like 10 jack of diamonds or pocket
14:26
sevens with a spade. We would love for
14:28
those hands to stick around because we
14:30
think we can get them to fold on the
14:31
river. So, we go small. Our opponent
14:33
calls, we get to the river. And going to
14:35
this river, we've kept our opponent's
14:36
range wide and weak. By choosing the
14:38
small size on the flop, they would raise
14:39
hands like nines, fours, king n suited.
14:41
By choosing the small size on the turn,
14:43
they would raise hands like flushes. So
14:44
getting to this river, the best hand
14:46
they're going to have with a high
14:47
frequency is going to be one pair, top
14:49
pair for king X. So what size should we
14:51
bluff on this river? If I was value
14:53
betting here and I wanted a hand like
14:55
king, queen to call, we'd probably have
14:57
to go relatively small. Look, so I'm a
14:59
magic poker wizard. Look, we have ace
15:01
jack of spades. What size do we want to
15:03
go to get king queen to call? Probably
15:05
something like a medium size value wants
15:07
to go less than pot here because we're
15:09
trying to get king queen king jack to
15:11
call. This is the point to run the big
15:13
boy bluff when we have six high. We can
15:15
go 1.5 2x pot here and just get our
15:18
opponent to fold 90 95% of their range.
15:21
Don't choose the medium size with the
15:23
bluff when our opponent is super capped
15:25
getting to the river. So we talked about
15:27
when we want to choose the big boy size
15:28
with the bluff on the river. What about
15:30
the big boy size with value? So, let me
15:31
show you. And this time, we're going to
15:33
three bet pocket queens on the button.
15:34
Our opponent's going to call. We see bet
15:36
on the flop. Our opponent calls. We bank
15:37
a queen on the turn. And on this turn,
15:40
we're going to choose a small size
15:42
because we'd love for our opponent to
15:43
continue with 10 x with ace five, ace4,
15:47
pocket jacks, pocket nines, those type
15:49
of hands. We're going to choose a small
15:51
size here. Our opponent calls. We get an
15:52
ace on the river. And when our opponent
15:53
checks it over, what is our opponent's
15:55
range? Well, they're going to have two
15:57
distinct portions of their range.
15:58
keeping it very very elementary. They're
16:00
going to have weak stuff, 10 n suited
16:02
and pocket nines and pocket jacks and
16:05
those hands aren't going to call if we
16:07
breathe on this pot. But they're also
16:08
going to have a ton of strong stuff on
16:10
this river, right? They're going to have
16:11
hands like ace 10, ace five suited, ace4
16:13
suited, right? We chose a small size on
16:15
the turn, so those hands would stick
16:16
around. So, they're going to have a lot
16:18
of two pair getting to this river. The
16:21
weak stuff is going to fold if we
16:22
breathe on it. The strong stuff is not
16:24
folding no matter what. We can run into
16:25
some brick walls here. If we were
16:27
bluffing, we'd be thinking, "Oh, I would
16:28
hate to go big here because we can just
16:30
run into ace 10, ace five, ace4."
16:32
Therefore, with value, this is the spot.
16:34
Put in all the money, get called, and we
16:36
are going to win with pocket quickly.
16:38
All right, next spot where we don't want
16:40
to use these medium sizes facing a check
16:42
raise and then a check on a nutchanging
16:44
turn. That's a that's a mouthful, but
16:46
I'll I'll explain. So, we open ace
16:48
queen. Our opponent's going to call. We
16:50
see bet with a nut flush draw. Our
16:51
opponent check raises. We're going to
16:52
call and now the turn is a seven, and
16:54
our opponent checks it over. So, what is
16:56
our opponent's range when they check
16:58
raise on the flop and then check on this
17:00
turn? It's mostly going to be two pair
17:03
and sets. Why is that? Why aren't they
17:05
going to have a lot of flushes here on a
17:07
wet dynamic board like 954? What does
17:10
our opponent fast play all of the time
17:12
when we choose a small size and they're
17:13
out of position? Pocket fives, pocket
17:15
fours, 54 suited, pocket 9ines. These
17:17
hands probably get check raised 80 90%
17:20
of the time. How often do they check
17:21
raise flush draws? Well, let's give them
17:23
credit. Let's say maybe 10 15% of the
17:25
time. So going to the turn, they've got
17:26
90% of their value combos, two pair
17:28
plus, they've got 10% of their flush
17:30
draws. Now the flush completes on the
17:31
turn. The type of player who's going to
17:33
be aggressive and check raise a flush
17:34
draw on the flop. What are they going to
17:35
do when the flush gets there on the
17:36
turn? Mostly bet, right? So we see here
17:39
on the turn that they just don't have
17:40
many flushes in their range, but they
17:43
have a whole [ __ ] ton of two pair and
17:45
sets. So what size do we want to go on
17:47
this turn? Not medium. I like to choose
17:50
a very egregiously large size here,
17:51
something like 400. Why? because I don't
17:54
think players are going to fold two pair
17:56
and sets just because the flush came in.
17:58
Going small doesn't make sense because
18:00
they're not going to raise two pair and
18:02
sets when the flush came in and they
18:03
don't have many flushes in their range
18:04
that are going to put in the raise for
18:06
us. Remember we talked about why and
18:08
going medium doesn't make sense because
18:09
we're not winning the maximum amount of
18:11
value against their two pair in sets.
18:12
Choose the biggest size here that two
18:14
pair and sets are going to call. If
18:15
you're against a more sticky player, you
18:16
may be able to go bigger than this. If
18:17
you're against a more nitty tight
18:19
player, you may have to go around 300.
18:21
Don't choose the middle size. That is a
18:23
mistake in my not so humble opinion.
18:26
Finally, let's talk about four
18:27
exceptions to the rule where it is okay
18:29
to choose the medium size. Number one,
18:31
when we see bet as the pre flop razor in
18:33
a single race pot. So, we're going to
18:34
open here on the button. Our opponent
18:36
calls Jack nine deuce. And as you guys
18:38
like to know, I like to choose the
18:39
medium size here. It's not really about
18:42
the size being half pot. It's more about
18:44
what size will they raise the strong
18:46
stuff and call with the weak stuff. And
18:47
in a single race pot, we can get away
18:49
with half pot because the absolute size
18:51
of the pot is smaller. Remember, in a
18:52
three bet pot, we were going something
18:53
like 1/3 pot. If we went multi-way, we'd
18:56
have to go a little bit smaller because
18:57
the absolute size of the pot's going to
18:58
be bigger. We're in a three- bet pot, we
19:00
got to go a little bit smaller. But
19:01
usually in these single race pots, I
19:02
start off somewhere around half pot
19:04
because to me, that has been kind of the
19:06
magical elixir point where opponents
19:08
will do exactly what we want, raise the
19:10
strong stuff, call out the weak stuff.
19:11
Of course, there are exceptions. There
19:13
are some boards where this is not true.
19:14
There are some players where this is not
19:16
true, but a lot of the time, this is
19:17
going to be my breadand butter starting
19:19
point. Exception number two, where I do
19:20
like to use the medium bet in four bet
19:22
pots on low low boards. So, let me show
19:24
you this one. We are going to face an
19:26
open at three bet. We cold for four bet
19:27
with the second best hand in poker.
19:28
We're going to get called by the cutoff.
19:30
And on these low low boards, I actually
19:31
like to choose this medium size, which
19:33
is a big size in a four bet pot, right?
19:36
I like to choose this medium size
19:37
because if our opponent has a hand like
19:40
nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings,
19:42
they're not folding no matter what on
19:44
this board. So, let's maximize value
19:46
against the portion of our opponent's
19:48
range that's going to be super super
19:50
super inelastic here. And yes, we're
19:52
going to lose some value if they have a
19:54
hand like ace king or ace queen suited.
19:56
That's okay because we just get to play
19:57
a two street game against our opponents
20:00
when they do have a hand like pocket
20:01
queens and they're probably not going to
20:03
fold if we can get in the money before
20:06
scary cards come before the nuts change
20:08
before an overcard comes. So I like to
20:09
play two street games. Choose this
20:11
medium size maybe two/3 pot. But it's a
20:14
big absolute size. Maybe something like
20:16
$200, $250 in a 25 game on the flop.
20:19
This is one of the exceptions where I
20:20
think the medium size is pretty pretty
20:22
good. All right, another exception where
20:23
our bluffs want to go medium. But I'm
20:25
not going to start off with our bluff.
20:26
I'm going to start off with kind of a
20:27
thick value hand. So this one we're
20:29
going to open sixes. Our opponent's
20:30
going to call. We're going to see bet
20:31
with bottom set. They call. We're going
20:32
to over bet on this blankish turn. Can
20:34
our opponent have some straits? Yes. But
20:36
they're mostly capped. So we're going to
20:38
choose the big size. We go to a river,
20:39
which is an ace. And when our opponent
20:40
checks it over, we've seen kind of a
20:42
similar example to this. On this ace
20:44
river, our opponent can have some two
20:46
pair. They can have some ace queen, ace
20:48
six of spades, ace four of spades. they
20:50
could just have a strong ace of spades
20:52
like ace jack of spades or ace 10 of
20:54
spades or something like that. So our
20:55
opponent has a lot of strong hands with
20:58
our thick value with a hand like sixes
21:00
here. I would want to choose the big boy
21:02
size targeting those strong hands. And
21:04
if we did have a thin value hand like ax
21:06
on this river now I wouldn't be
21:08
targeting the strong hands. We can just
21:10
target hands like queen jack or queen
21:11
king on this river. So I'd want to go
21:13
very very small here. Maybe one/3 pot,
21:16
maybe slightly bigger. Whatever we think
21:17
queen jack, queen king will call on this
21:19
river. So thick value wants to go very
21:21
very big. Thin value wants to go pretty
21:23
pretty small. And if we get to this
21:24
river with the bluff, that's where we
21:26
want to choose the medium size. Why?
21:28
Because our thick value wanted to go
21:29
very big to target hands like ace queen,
21:31
a6, ace4, etc. Our thin value, ace five
21:34
of spades, wanted to go very, very small
21:35
to make sure a hand like queen jack or
21:37
queen king would call. That means the
21:38
medium size we don't lose our entire
21:39
stack when our opponent does end up with
21:41
a strong hand on this river like ace
21:42
queen. And the medium size we can get
21:44
hands like queen king, queen jack, queen
21:46
10, queen n suited. we can get all of
21:48
these hands to fold. This is one example
21:50
where the medium size with a bluff may
21:53
be very good when our value wants to go
21:55
either very very big or very very small.
21:57
Sometimes the bluff wants to choose this
21:59
medium size. It's a rare exception. It
22:01
doesn't happen a whole lot but it does
22:03
happen. So I'm not going to say never
22:04
ever use the medium size. This is one of
22:06
the examples where I think having it in
22:08
your arsenal could be pretty good.
22:09
Finally, last example. We open 8 n of
22:12
diamonds here and we're going to see
22:13
bet. We are going to double barrel here
22:16
for the big size on this turn. Now we
22:17
get to the river and this is one of
22:19
those spots where our bluff wants to
22:22
either go very very small here on this
22:25
river and the goal with this small size
22:27
would be can we just fold their draw. So
22:30
small here with the bluff could be an
22:31
option. Alternatively, if we're against
22:33
a player who we think has a reasonable
22:35
fold button, big here could also be an
22:37
option, right? because we're just not
22:38
really going to run into really any
22:40
brick walls on this river with the
22:42
exception of maybe ace three of clubs.
22:45
The best hand they're going to get here
22:46
with a high frequency is going to be
22:47
hand like ace 10. And if we think we can
22:48
get king 10, queen 10, jack 10, 10 nine,
22:51
we think we can get these hands to fold
22:52
for an all-in size, then the all-in big
22:54
boy size with the bluff here may be
22:56
another viable option. So with value,
22:58
where does that leave us? Not too big,
23:00
not too small, just right. This is the
23:02
one exception with value where we may
23:03
want to choose this medium size. And by
23:06
medium, you see I'm still going over
23:08
pot, right? I'm still choosing a bigger
23:10
size than pot because I think 10x is
23:12
going to call for slightly bigger than
23:14
pot here. But it is the medium size of
23:16
the three options. So the last exception
23:18
here when bluffs want to go either very
23:20
very big or very small. Sometimes the
23:22
value wants to go right smack dab in the
23:25
middle. All right, guys. Hopefully this
23:26
video on when to eliminate the medium
23:29
size from your game helps you level up
23:32
and become the biggest boy possible.
23:34
Thank you guys and have a gentle
