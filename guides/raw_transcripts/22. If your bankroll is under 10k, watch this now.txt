if you have less than a $10,000 bankroll to play poker and you want to become a more profitable player I'm going to give
you six steps to get there quickly I've earned over seven figures playing myself and I've helped over 150 players become
big Winners with many of them now earning over six figures annually so let's Jump Right In Step number one
don't memorize internalize one of the biggest differences I've noticed between weak or novice players and very very
strong players is weak players are always looking for a solution they want that Curiosity it scratched basically
did I play ace queen with the Ace of clubs and the Queen of Diamonds right in this spot did I choose the right size on
this River whereas strong players are zooming out and looking for a bigger picture takeaway when going back and
reviewing a hand keep in mind we are never going to play this exact spot against this exact villain in this exact
configuration at this exact table ever again so the answer is almost irrelevant
what is useful is being able to glean a big picture takeaway from a hand that we can apply to many more spots down the
road so let me give you a few concrete examples so some of this starts to make sense all right so we are playing 25
we're going to open on the button to 25 villain in the big blind is going to call flop 1084 so we flop a gutshot two
overs and a back door flush draw we see about half pot the villain calls turn is a deuce we overb the villain calls we go
to a river now which is an offit 3 and we think the villain is capped so we're going to put in all the money here best
hand that villains have in this spot a lot of the times is a hand like 10x we think we can get that to fold we go all in villain calls and he shows Ace eight
of Hearts here for second pair all right so my big picture take away from the spot I try not to get too zoomed in this
villain is just calling way too much even when they have a weak range so what
do we do about it well if he's calling with Ace 8 here that means he's never folding a 10 in a million years he's
never folding pocket NES so that just means every time we get to the spot with a hand that's Jack 10 Queen 10 or better
we should just always be taking this line for Value we should be going much thinner for Value we should be using
much bigger sizes we no longer are going to take this line as a bluff this player is just calling way too much so
therefore we should be going absolutely huge for thin value and when we have a bluff we should be toning those down it
doesn't mean we should never bluff if we get to this River with this particular hand maybe we just go very very small to try to get him to fold out his acex King
X Queen X of clubs we're never trying to get him to fold a very good hand conversely let's say we have Ace Queen
we open on the button and a different villain's going to call in the big blind we flop top pair we SE bet we continue on the turn for a big size villain calls
we go to a river we're trying to get a hand like Queen X to Hero us down we go pot on the river and villain actually
flashes a queen and he folds aha so against this particular villain who's probably folding near top of their range
to us on this River if they're folding a queen they just don't have many better hands here we think about it because generally players are just going to fast
play hands like pocket sixes or pocket 3es so Queen X is one of the best hands they get here with that means this player is just folding too much so these
thoughts almost sound stupid and Elementary when you say them out loud but it's very very easy poker can be easy if you let it be easy this player
is folding too much so that means we should be over bluffing but doesn't that mean we're going to be unbalanced no we
are just responding to our opponent being unbalanced and because our opponent is massively over folding here
that means we should be turning everything with no Showdown value and even some hands with a smidge of Showdown value into Bluffs here because
our Bluffs are going to overperform versus equilibrium if they're over folding we should be over bluffing and
we need to be using smaller size with our value and going less thinly for value on Rivers because against players
who overfolded all right so if they overall we go thinner and bigger if they over
fold we Bluff everything what about if they under Bluff all right next example villain opens from the lowjack we defend
in the big blind we flop top pair villain seets we call turns a blank he double barrels we call River is a queen
we check it over and villain actually checks back Queen 10 of clubs here in
this spot my big picture takeaway would probably be oh this player is probably under bluffing cuz if we look at this
board in a high triple Broadway board when villain opens from the lowjack what are the natural Bluffs on the river Jack
10 gets there so maybe hands really exclusively like 10 n of clubs eight n of clubs when they open from the lowjack
they just don't have really many Bluffs here at all and if they're not turning Queen X of clubs into a bluff on this
River where are the Bluffs coming from really in the spot hands like 7x pocket
sixes pocket fives queenex of clubs all these hands are supposed to be turned into Bluffs but a villain is checking
back and just incorrectly deducing that they have Showdown value with a hand like Queen X of clubs on this river that
means they are massively under bluffing so big picture takeaway when someone is under bluffing very very easy we should just be massively overfolded if villain
would bet on this River and we have a of diamonds we just have a bluff Catcher And if they are under bluffing every
single Bluff catcher is more profitable as a fold than as a call so keep it simple big picture takeaways finally a
fourth and Final is going to open on the butt in this hand we defended the big blind with Jack eight of clubs we flop top pair check it over he SE bets we
call turn is a blank he double barrels we call again now the river is a three we check it over and vill go is pretty
big and in general in live poker triple barrels especially when our opponent uses big sizes are under bluffed so we
think about it on this River and we actually decide to fold our weak top pair and as villain is throwing his
cards into the muck they accidentally flip over and we see that our opponent has seven six of diamonds here that he
bluffed us with so if we saw this hand we could just deduce that this villain is massively over bluffing in spots like
this single race pots heads up in position in wide vers wide configurations so think about all of the
natural Bluffs that get here all the small Spades all the busted gut shots and open and straight draws if he's
bluffing with seven six of diamonds he is massively over bluffing in this spot and if villain is over bluffing our
adjustment just whenever we have a bluff catcher we are going to click that call Button because they have shifted the
equilibrium to bluffing too much so we then are just going to call quite a bit more all right so these examples are
very very very basic but I believe especially when playing live poker at low stakes we should be keeping our thought process very very very simple so
if we can just start zooming out and looking for a why in every situation instead of just trying to scratch our
curiosity itch in that hey what should I do with this hand well that is how to
get better very very quickly at poker bad players are obsessed with results great players are obsessed with process
all right step number two to build our bankroll preflex all right so very very simple the less our skill Edge the less
hands we can play profitably if you look at a small losing player or a break even player they're probably still massively
profitable when they have pocket aces pocket kings ace King suited Etc right when they have a card Advantage they are
still winning money when they have good cards so basically until we start to build the skill one of the quickest ways
we can just start winning money immediately is to just play less hands we want to be very very tight from early
position and we can start to open up and play a little wider from later position and this goes for open raises ISO raises
and three betting so let me show you this may be my open range from early position at 200 big blinds we see here
it is relatively tight only off suit ax hands we're opening here are Ace King and Ace Queen suited connectors maybe 65
plus pocket pair 6s plus we're opening these wheel Aces but not the ace8 A7 A6
a du just very very tight here from early position at 200 big blinds only
about 12% of hands and if you're a newer player if you're a beginning player if you still feel uncomfortable if you
still haven't established yourself as a winner yet it's okay to just like take out these pseudo connectors take out
some of these small pocket pairs take out some of this acex wheel stuff and just go even tighter maybe play 9% 10%
of hands from early position again the more insignificant our skill Edge is the less hands we should play so in general
85 90% of the time we want to be entering the pot with an aggressive action with a raise with a three bet
with an ISO especially in a live environment where rake is high or they're going to be taking a drop we generally just want to be coming in with
an aggressive action so if it folds to us we are either raising or we are folding if someone limps and it folds to
us we are either ISO raising or we are folding if someone opens and it gets to us we are either three betting or we are
folding if one player opens and another player three bets and it gets to us we are either four betting or we are
folding you guys get the point almost all the time we should be coming into the pot with an aggressive action now we can make a couple exceptions one when we
are on the button we can have some calls because we're going to have absolute position post flop two when we are in the big blind we can have some calls
because we are closing the action pre flop and number three don't go overboard with this but if a very very strong
player opens and there are multiple fish behind we can be doing some calling so let me show you just a quick example of
this one all right so let's say the world's best two5 player opens in the lowjack here and it folds to Us in the
cut off and we have pocket 10 and look at this we have three fish behind us a fish on the button fish in the small Blind Fish in the big blind so this is a
spot where I would be doing a lot of calling because who is going to be making the biggest mistakes post flop
well certainly not the world's best 25 player but these fish behind us these players are probably making 100 200 big
blind mistakes post flop we would love to let them come in so this would be one of the rare spots where I am not on the
button or in the big blind where I may do some calling pre flop all right when we talk about squeeze spots say one
player opens see we see the lowjack opens and then another player in the field or multiple players in the field
are going to call when we're talking about what hands to squeeze here we want to go linear linear linear and what does
this mean we want to use our good hands our better hands and our best hands you see we aren't squeezing hands like 76
suited or ace3 suited or King six suited we're not squeezing the garbage we're squeezing all of the good stuff that
upper leftand corner of the hand balloon chart so why do we want to go linear here because what's going to happen a
lot of the time if we squeeze here well the lowjack the original player is going to call quite a bit and that's going to
bring in the two players behind we just very very unlikely when one player opens and somebody else calls or multiple
players call to take it down pre- flop we're going to be seeing a flop a lot so we just want hands that can kind of out
pip our opponents if our opponents are never folding pocket sixes or pocket fives well pocket 9's is going to play
very very well if our opponents are never folding a hand like Ace 10 suited or Ace 5 suited well Ace Jack and Ace
Queen are going to play very very well again we're going to see a flop a lot of the time when we squeeze so we just want
to use very very good hands here that can just kind of outand our opponents all right next Point here when playing
against recreational players we want to play against ranges not configurations
what does this mean well a recreational player doesn't know what a lowjack open range or a cutof three bet range looks
like right that's why they're a recreational player often times wck players are just going to have these are the hands I open and these are the hands
I thre re bet and it doesn't matter if they're under the gun if they're in the lowjack if they're in the cut off if
they're on the button they just have the hands they play and position is kind of irrelevant so we should be responding to
their range rather than worrying about configuration so verus a super tight wreck player who's opening 7.5 8% of
hands or something like that this may be our continue range on the button against a more aggressive wreck player who's
opening maybe 30% of hands this may be our continue range on the button so
again it's all about what is their range not necessarily the configuration because they don't even know how to
spell configuration finally as a general concept we want to defend much wider when we are very very deep and we want
to be extremely extremely tight when we are shallow so let me show you an example we opened seven six of Hearts
here on the button now the big blind three bets to 80 and we see the big blind only started this hand off 300
effective this is just a slam dunk very very easy fold when we have a hand like
7 six of heart parts now conversely we're going to open on the button and the villain in the big blind is going to
three bet and you see here we start this hand off 2,000 effective so we're 400 big blinds deep now even a hand as weak
as 74 suited here could be a profitable continue assuming that we're going to have a skill Edge when we're in position
again the deeper we are the more skill comes into play so if we have a skill Edge on a player and we're 400 big
blinds deep we're going to be able to punish them if we're 40 or 50 big blinds deep we're not going to be able to punish them this is with the caveat that
we do have a skill Edge if this is against a very strong player again we should just be continuing very very
tight here probably would just pitch a hand like 74 but if we do have a skill Edge we could continue when we are this
deep all right step number three to building that bank roll learn how to range all right so with each action that
a villain takes in a hand we should be putting them on a specific range of hands and we can start to eliminate
parts of their range based on things they have done in the hand what we want to do we want to think in buckets all
the way to the river so we don't want to get too zoomed in on oh this guy has 9 seven of spa no no no no no no instead
we want to be putting the range in buckets like hey this guy has some thick value because he has top pair or hey
this guy has some high Equity draws because he's got a bunch of straight draws plus F draws see we can just say he's got thick value he's got high
Equity draws we don't need to be thinking about specific combos at least until we get to the river the earlier it
is in the hand the bigger the buckets we should be thinking and don't start over on each street right it is very very
important that we're able to carry that thread all the way through from pre- flop to the turn to the river so if
we've eliminated hands that they can't have based on the pre flop action we don't just start over on the flap we have to be able to keep in mind that
we've eliminated they don't have Aces they don't have Kings they don't have Queens because those hands would have taken a different action pre flop if we
have already eliminated them so let me give you a couple of examples we're going to be in the cutof here and we're actually going to fold and we're going
to play this hand and use exercise that I find actually very valuable when playing live we're just going to range the two players in the hand if you're
sitting at a live table instead of just being on our phone this is something we can do that is productive to build that muscle range the players in the hands
that we are not in where you're going to see a button versus big blind situation here first we're going to walk through
this hand ranging the button then we're going to walk through ranging the big blind okay so the button opens we can
just eliminate maybe the bottom of his range some of the trash because he did open he did say hey I would like to play
a pot here now the big blind is going to check and the button is going to see bet could this player be SE betting their
entire range here for this size possibly we can't really eliminate much so the button is still going to have a very
wide range now the big blind calls we go to a turn and now the button checks back now we can eliminate a bunch of stuff
what can we eliminate well a bunch of his very strong hands basically the hands that we would classify as hands that can play for Stacks right his thick
thick value hands his sets his straights his two pair because those hands would keep betting on this turn so the button
after checking back this turn probably has a range that looks something like some air some Showdown value and and
maybe some draws we go to a river which is an ace let's think about button range again air Showdown value and maybe some
draws what does this Ace do well it creates a lot of top pair for the button who could have just been see betting his
range on the Flop had a bunch of ace high so the button now getting to this River has some thick value some top pair
and he just has some air as well all right now let's play the same hand from the big blinds perspective here and when
the big blind calls an open we can Lop off the top of the big blind's range right cuz they're just going to three
bet their premium premium hands here so we can just eliminate the top we can eliminate the bottom going to a flop now
the button C bets for about half pot in the big blend calls well when the board is this wet in Dynamic and the big blind
just calls we can start to eliminate a lot of their compl for stacks and thick thick thick value here they're probably
going to raise quite a bit when they have straight sets to pair so the Big blind's Range here after calling this beted on the flap is going to be some
Thin value some Showdown value and some draws we go to a turn the turn goes check check and again getting to this
River the big blind has some Thin value some Showdown value and some draws and now the big blind comes out and Bets pot
on this River so we could probably eliminate the thin value and The Showdown value like big blind's not
going to do this with 10x or 8X or pocket fives or something like that when the river is an ace big blind's range is
going to be the thick value where they made some asex maybe on this river that floated or they're just going to have
some air that is trying to Bluff and buy the pot we can eliminate The Showdown value and the thin value from the action
that they took on this River all right another one here we are just going to fold hold in the lowjack the cut off is
going to open and the button is going to three bet and the cut off is going to call first let's play this hand from the
button perspective when the button three bets they cut off open they are going to have a strong range we can eliminate a
lot of the middle a lot of the bottom cut off checks it over button SE bets we can't really eliminate a lot here they could just be SE betting their range
here so not much we can really take away from this so far we go to a turn which is a king and now the button is going to
double barrel here for a pretty chunky size and at this point we could probably start eliminating some stuff like thin
value and Showdown value from the buttons range they did have a hand like pocket eights pocket 10s pocket Jacks
pocket Queens those hands are probably not going to bet on this turn so the buttons range is going to be some thick
value and it's going to be some draws going to the river now the river is an ace cut off checks it over and button
puts the money in I've talked in buckets all the way getting to the river now that we've gotten to the river maybe we
can talk about some specific hands that button might do this with it's probably going to be hand hands like two pair
Plus for Value hands like Ace King hands like pocket NES hands like Ace 9 or
king9 suited maybe even an occasional strong top pair for Value a hand like Ace Queen of Diamonds Ace jack of
diamonds something like that then for the Bluffs we're talking about maybe some gut shots here like Jack 10 Queen
10 Queen Jack stuff like that so again buttons range getting to this river is going to be a lot of strong top pair
plus two pair sets and maybe a couple of busted gut shots and draws that did not
get there let's play the same situation from Cut off's perspective he opens here in the button three bets and when the
cut off just calls here again we can Lop off the very top of his range because he would probably for bet with his very
very strong hands we can eliminate the bottom of his range because he's not opening and calling a three bet with
trash here most of the time so the cut off is going to have kind of that upper middle portion of his range getting to
the flop flop comes 93 Deuce button bets and cut off just calls we can probably eliminate some of the compl play for
Stacks real real real thick value in the cut offs range that may just raise here at a high frequency but when he calls
here he still got some Thin value he still got some thick value he still got some Showdown value he still got some draws but we can eliminate the air the
very bottom of his range we can eliminate some of the tip tip tip top of his range that would maybe fast play here on the flap we go to a turn which
is a king cutof off checks it over button barrels and the cut off calls again and at this point we can start eliminating some of the Showdown value
some of the thin value a lot of this stuff would just be folding now from the cutoff on the turn so his range is going
to be a lot of thick value and a lot of draws we go to the river now which is an ace cut off checks it over and button
goes all in and at this point we can start talking in terms of hands instead of just buckets remember we said the cut off had some draws had some thick value
well some of the draws bricked on this River so now the cut off has some air some of the draws made top pair so cut off now has some Thin value some of cut
off's thick value hands like King X of diamonds have now been downgraded to thin value and he does have some two
pair now hands like Ace King so the cutof here on this River has thick value he's got his two pair he's got some Thin
value his acex of diamonds he's got some Showdown value his King X of diamonds
and then he's got some air maybe his Jack High 10 high eight High diamonds that bricked on this River all right so
see how we thought in buckets all the way to the river and we eliminated portions of their range with each
specific action and the way to get very very good at this is just practice it's just reps it's just do it over and over
and as you start to improve what I would recommend is adding time pressure until this becomes second nature so practi
this at home just look at random hand histories that poker players post and just come up with the ranges of the
players in the hand and apply time pressure give yourself a minute per Street then 30 seconds per Street then
15 seconds per Street and the more work you do the more time pressure you apply the more this will become second nature
all right step number four to building the bankroll ask the right questions all right so you may have heard me talk
about this we call this the repeatable thought process and essentially it's just a list of questions that we can ask
in every hand that help us come to the best decision so the questions I may ask in every hand first what is their range
which we just talked about next question I ask are they capped this just means do they have their can for Stacks their thick thick value hands right they're
very very strong hands if they are capped that means no they don't have those thick thick value hands and if
they are uncapped that means yes they do have the thick thick value hands they do have the top of their range so the next
question I ask here if they are capped do they have inelastic hands right they may not have the very tip top of the
range but maybe they just have top pair hands that just are never folding because there's a bunch of draws out there or maybe they have very strong
draws in their range that are just never folding because they'd like to see a river and if they are uncapped I ask
will they raise their strong stuff if we choose a small size so you see here these are the questions I'm frequently
asking first in hands and last week in the video I built this flowchart essentially just breaking it down in a
much more granular way I tried to say granularly but it's it's a hard word to granularly Gran say that word three
times fast you see here I just ask what's their range and if they're uncapped we ask will they fast play their strong stuff and if they're capped
we just ask do they have in elastic hands if you like a lot more detailed explanation of how this flowchart works
and how we kind of work through it you can watch that video we put it out on our Channel last week after determining if they're capped or not the next
question I ask is what happens if right I like to consider all of the options what happens if I bet small what happens
if I bet large what happens if I check and I like to walk through those three basic options basically try not to come
to answer and then support it with reasons why so a way I wouldn't recommend thinking is I'm going to bet big because villains will call a lot
they have an elastic see you see I've already determined that I'm betting big without considering all the other options so before I come to a decision
I'm always asking what happens if I do a what happens if I do B what happens if I do c and then I weigh those three
options against each other and come to a decision instead of coming to a decision and then trying to support the decision
the final question I like to ask in every hand when I get to a river I ask what would I do with the inverse so let
me give you a few Crystal Clear concrete examples let's walk through this together all right so we are going to open here on the button with ace3 of
Spades the villain in the big blind is going to call it's going to check over to us and the first question I'd be
asking here is what is their range well it's probably going to be wide but we can eliminate the very bottom we can eliminate the very top right are they
capped or uncapped they could have very strong hands on this board right they could have pocket nines they could have pocket Deuces they could have Jack n
suited they can even have pocket Jack sometimes so our opponent is uncapped will they fast play their strong stuff
well yes on this board they would probably fast play their strong stuff because the board is wet and dynamic they're scared of a bad turn card coming
in so villains will Fast play their strong stuff what happens if well if we bet large villains going to be less
likely to fast play their strong stuff they're probably just going to be doing a lot more calling with their strong hands they're going to fold out a bunch
of their weak hands like pocket eights pocket sixes or whatever and they're just going to call with a bunch of top
pair their good draws and some of their traps what happens if we bet small here villain is going to fast play whenever
they have a very strong hand like Jack n pocket 's pocket Deuces but they're also just going to call with a bunch of weak
[ __ ] hands like pocket eights sevens gut shots ace high and that's pretty good for us because they're going to let us
know right now when they have a strong hand they're also going to call with a bunch of weak stuff which allows us profitable barreling opportunities
across turns and rivers finally what happens if we check back well villain's probably going to be pretty transparent
on the turn they're probably just going to come out and bet their strong stuff and check their weak stuff at a pretty high frequency they may have some sizing
tells but we can get all of that information right here on the Flop by betting small and we can apply a lot more pressure to the weaker parts of
villains range by starting a triple barrel right here right now and also building a big pot so when we do hit we
just get paid we weigh all the options between large small and check I determine that I like small here the
best so we are going to go small the villain is going to call we go to a turn which is the four of Spades villain checks it over what is villain's range
well it actually changes a lot on this turn because villain can have some very strong hands so it's range here is going to be some Showdown value some Thin
value some very very thick value here and some draws like some straight draws as well so is villain capped or uncapped
villain is uncapped because they can actually have flushes here in general in live poker most players are going to play their draws more on the passive
side so villain can just have a ton of flushes getting to this turn what happens if we bet large villain's probably just going to call us with
their baby fleshes they may call with Jack X but they're going to start folding out anything weaker than maybe hands like King Jack or queen Jack here
if we bet large they're going to fold the hands that we have drawing dead like King 10 Queen 10 with a spade something
like that they're going to fold their 9x they're going to fold their pocket eights so if we go large we're going to get a lot of folding some calling maybe
some flushes with fast play but maybe not at a super high frequency what happens if we bet small well if villain does have a flush here a hand like seven
eight of spades if we bet small they're probably going to put in more money for us so the flushes are going to raise we get a ton of money from the flushes even
if we bet small their weak hands also if we bet small here are going to call so going small seems like a pretty
appealing option what happens if we check back just going to lose a ton of value against the top of villains range so we could cooler here and get in more
money on the turn and we're also going to lose value against the weaker parts of villains range it's going to be maybe a little bit sticky on the turn if we
choose a small bet here so we weighed going large we weighed going small and we weighed checking back I think going
small has the most Merit here on the turn the important thing is that we weighed all of the options and went
through our list of questions before coming to a decision we are going to go small in our opponent calls we go to a
river which is an offit 6 and again on this River I would be asking what is our opponent's range at this point we can
start talking in terms of hands instead of buckets because we got to the river we can probably eliminate flushes because a lot of the flushes would just
raise on the turn when we bet small we can eliminate a lot of the sets in two pair because those would raise on the flap so villains range on this river is
going to be pretty capped and pretty weak probably the best hands they get here with are probably something like Ace Jack so they are capped here so now
on this River before I determine my sizing I'm going to ask what would I do with the inverse so what would I do here
if I got to this River with a hand like Queen pen of clubs well again I think the best hand our opponent can have
would maybe be a hand like Ace Jack I don't think that hand's going to be in elastic I think it's going to fold to a lot of pressure so if I had a hand like
Queen High I may choose the size to try to get Ace Jack to fold maybe something like $250 $260 I think that gets it done
all the time switching back we actually have a flush here we would like Ace Jack to call so I'm obviously going much
smaller than that 250 to 260 size maybe I choose a size somewhere around 100 maybe around 125 and we are going to get
called all right one more example here we're going to open on the button with nine ative clubs the big blind is going to call Queen 75 what is our opponent's
range here what we can eliminate the very top because those hands would three bet pre- flop we can eliminate the very bottom because those hands would fold
pre- flop so now here on this board is villain capped or uncapped while they are uncapped they can still have very
strong hands like pocket sevens pocket fives 75 suited maybe Queen seven or queen five suited so they are uncapped
will our opponent fast play their strong stuff well probably yes on this board because the board is wet and dynamic there's straight draws there's a flush
draw out there so yes they will raise their strong stuff and now finally what happens if if we go large here opponents
will raise their strong stuff less they will fold a bunch of their weak stuff and if we go small here opponents will Fast play their strong stuff and they
will call with their weak stuff and if we check back here on the flap which we could consider opponents will kind of be face up on the turn with what they have
by the sizing and the action they choose so the two options I may consider here are either checking back or going small
we can eliminate the going large I'm much more comfortable with just going small and keeping our options open across turns and Rivers making it seem
like we are uncapped so giving oursel every single option in the game tree so I think those two are close but I'm going to decide to go small here on this
flop villain now calls turn is a three what is villains range where we can eliminate the tippy top of our
opponent's range and the bottom of our opponent's range so our opponent's going to have some thick value some Thin value some Showdown value some draws getting
to this turn are they capped or uncapped well they're probably capped here with a small caveat they don't have fives they
don't have sevens they don't have seven five Queen s Queen five they don't have the two pair in the sets here with a
high frequency now could they have a hand like 6'4 occasionally yes but for the most part on this turn the villain
is going to be capped do they have inelastic hands and to that I would answer yes they're going to have some
inelastic hands they have some combo draws they have some ace high flesh draws they have some hands like Ace queen that are just never folding in a
million years when there's a bunch of draws out there they have a bunch of pair plus flush draws pair plus straight draws so yes they have in elastic hands
therefore because they're going to be in elastic on this turn both our Bluffs and our Val you probably want to choose a
very very large size here because opponents are going to be doing a lot of calling on this turn so we want to start
bloating a very big pot our value wants to bloat a very big pot so we can win a bigger pot on the river our Bluffs want
to bloat a very big pot because we think we can just take it away on the river by blasting our opponent off their value or
if it's a bad River we can just choose a small size and get our opponent to fold a bunch of their draws Etc villains just
going to have a ton of inelastic hands that are going to call on this turn that we can get to fold on the river so therefore I would go very large on this
turn villain's going to call we go to a river which is a queen now what is villain's range getting to the river
villain's going to have two big buckets and then a tiny third bucket is part of their range getting to this River they're going to have the very strong
part of their range which is going to be Queen X which now makes trips they're going to have the weak part of their range which is going to be their Diamond draws at bricked and finally a very very
small sliver of the range is just going to be hands like 5x of diamonds 3x of diamonds so we have nine High what would
I do with the inverse if we got to this River with a hand like pocket sevens with sevens I'd probably want to choose a very very large size here I may just
consider going all in because I don't think we're winning any more money whatsoever if our opponent just has ax of diamonds but if they have a hand like
Ace queen king queen queen Jack I don't think our opponent is folding trips on this River but we have nine High here
and we determined it's a very good spot to go large for Value so when we have a bluff maybe we just want to Target the
other portion of villain's range the acex of diamonds the king X of diamonds the 10 high nine High diamonds and we
can just get that stuff to fold with a very small bet so therefore our value wants to go large our value and Bluffs
like to split on the river when playing against we Live players so we are going to choose a small size here with nine
High just trying to get our opponent to fold out their better draws step number five to building that bank roll remember
we are not the hero so what do I mean by this well I think there's way too much emphasis put on what does the villain
think of us do they respect our game what is our image and I don't think any
of this [ __ ] matters what I think matters a lot more is just keeping in mind we are an extra in their story
right they the main character our image doesn't matter in fact we don't even matter instead we should be asking what
has happened to them what has happened to the villain are they up a lot of money are they tilted are they racking
up and locking up a wi for the day did they just get a bluff maybe windmilled in their face so let me show you a few
examples of how we can apply that and stop thinking in terms of what do they think of me because this doesn't matter
and start thinking in terms of what has happened in their Story So Far So first example here and pay attention to Horus
horse collar in the big blind he's not going to be in this hand but we open in the button the villain's going to call in the small blind and Horus horsecollar
folds and Horus horsecollar is going to be the villain that we're playing against next hand or a few hands down the road and in this hand we triple
barrel it off right we put in a ton of money in this hand and we end up getting snapped off and our opponent actually
shows five six of Spades so we end up getting snapped off in this hand one Orbit later we're on the button and we
see bulbas boy in the cutof raises to 20 horse horse collar in the big line three bets with Ace King and C bets on this
board bulbas boy calls he continues on the turn bulbas boy jams and Horus calls it off because he doesn't know the last
time someone raised a turn as a bluff in live poker George Washington Carver was President so he calls it off and he actually ends up getting stacked here by
five four of diamonds which bulas boy has this is a lot more important this matters Horus horse collar is now stuck
he lost a massive hand this is not a player we should be bluffing because he is down on the day and he is probably
tilting he's probably steaming he lost a massive pot this is important what is not important is this Bluff that we ran
last orbit because Horus horse collar was on his phone looking at new riding lawnmowers to purchase for his new home in New Hampshire it doesn't matter that
we have a bad image that we get caught bluffing because this is something that happened to us it did not happen to Horus horsecollar so try to keep in mind
that our opponents are going to be the hero of Their Own Story they're not really paying attention our image
doesn't matter what they think of us is irrelevant right what has happened to them is what is important all right
finally step number six stop wasting your bankroll I see so many players who have yet to establish a win rate yet to
establish a bankroll and they want private one-on-one coaching this is a waste of time it is a waste of money
there is so much loow hanging fruit you don't need private coaching you shouldn't be paying a 100 or 200 or 300
bucks an hour for someone to coach you there's so many leaks that you can diagnose for free or very cheap there is
a time and a place for one-on-one private coaching and I think it has its use cases but until we've established a
win rate until we've established a big bank roll I think it is just throwing money down the toilet and again also on
top of private coaching you don't need a very expensive program and that goes for programs like our 28-day boot camp at
Hungry Horse poker until you've established a bank roll until you've established your winning it's going to be a waste of time and money which is
why we're so specific about saying this program is for winning players who have established a win rate who are playing
50 plus hours a month until you get to that point you don't need private coaching you don't need an expensive
program and also you don't need a subscription to a solver this is not a good use of money it's not a good use of
time there's so much lwh hanging fruit in poker practice ranging practice your repeatable thought process you can do
these things for free so until we get to this point free content or even a cheap Training Site will suffice I don't think
you even need to spend any money at all really until you get to this point there's so much good free content on
YouTube so really just save the bankroll let the bankroll keep building don't waste it on this frivolous stuff that you don't necessarily need at this point
in your poker career and finally I just want to talk about active versus passive learning passive learning would be watching videos like this and that can
be great because good free content or training sites you're going to teach you what to do and why to do it but you're
really not going to make those giant steps until you actually transition to Active Learning so take the stuff that
we've learned in this video how to range opponents how to come up with a repeatable thought process and start
actually practicing it both off table setting aside a few hours per week that I'm going to sit down I'm going to
actively practice this stuff I'm going to write it down I'm going to cut out all distractions I'm not just going to be listening or watching I'm actually
going to do the exercise myself it's great to watch a YouTube video on how to go to the gym and do a squat perfectly
but if you don't go to the gym and do the squat or do the bench press you're never going to gain the muscle so hopefully this video was possible on how
to build that bankroll to 10K and then a 100K and Beyond thank you guys and have
a gentle day
