this poker player has more than tripled his win rate in the last year and today he is going to tell us how Alex was one
of the very first players we started working with at Hungry Horse and I'm going to pick his brain how he went from
treading water to absolutely crushing all right we're here with Alex Alex thank you for coming on today appreciate
you being here I'm happy to be here Mark uh really grateful for the opportunity and uh hoping to add some value to this
channel Alex what was poker like before Hungry Horse were you playing full-time hours were you winning what were what
were kind of your results like I was a full-time 13 500 cap grinder my results were very
mediocre and eventually I went on a pretty bad downswing and I was forced to
go back into selling insurance and grinding part-time and I stayed in that
Loop for about a year never was really able to get above water and get back to being a pro cuz I just I didn't make
enough from poker to save money what have your results looked like over the last
,500 hours or so when I was a 13 500 cap grinder I was making anywhere from 25 to
$30 an hour at 1,500 cap games I'm making about $90 an hour and at 510 it's
a small sample but I'm making a little bit over $150 an hour that's pretty impressive so we're talking about we're
talking north of 15 big blinds an hour what's been the biggest shift since coming on board Hungry Horse I went from
a pseudo GTO net thinking you know I had to be balanced against the guy five
Budweiser's deep in a NASCAR shirt to you know just thinking about how I could exploit everyone including people who
are playing for profit and pros and you know the thing I've realized being with Hungry Horse is that every single person
has leaks and can be exploited what advice would you give to someone who was in your shoes a couple years ago someone
who's playing low stakes trying to move up trying to play full-time trying to get to 510 plus consistently a few
pieces of advice one cancel your GTO wizard subscription uh two if you're going to
do any work with sers only do it to no luck um you know and just really focus
on how you know you can exploit people don't worry about equilibrium do a lot of work on your mental game get honest
with yourself find out what holds you back because everybody has you know some
level of cognitive dissonance and some internal belief systems that are limiting themselves from getting to
where they want to be in poker you know whether you have to pay for it or not you know Network and get advice from
people that are better than you and stay humble do not ever think you know everything and you never have anything
to learn can you elaborate on the mental game a little cuz that's something you know that's kind of a blind spot for me I never really you know I had a ton of
other issues trying to get to where I'm at as far as win rate but mental game was never something I really had to work on but I've heard from a lot of students
that's something that they've had to overcome so can you talk about kind of like what the problems you were having and and how you kind of overcame those I
was very risk averse um you know I did not like pulling the trigger on big Bluffs I did not like using huge sizes
with thin value and you know that went back to you know a fear of losing
everything I have that you know kind of was bought about by certain things in my upbringing and you know I had to
untangle those and realize how ridiculous and you know at of touch with
reality my fears actually were and you know I really wrote out like what was the worst case scenario that could
happen if I run a big Bluff or I value on myself for a huge size and realizing
that my fears really like weren't anything that I was making them out to
be in my head was a huge turning point for me getting past those mental game barriers was something that really
opened up a whole new world in poker for me okay so let me ask you you've made it to 510 you're winning at 18 bigs an hour
over the last year you're winning well over you know 130 140 bucks an hour plus
at 510 now what's next what are what are the next goals what do you want to check off next I obviously want to continue to
move up in Stakes I still think there's room for me to increase my hourly at the bigger gam so I think that's ultimately
the first baby step I really want to give back what was given to me and you know I'm just super grateful for Mark
you know Charlie gethin all the other coaches in the stable who you know saw the potential and me didn't give up up
on me and pushed me to be my best so I I want to be able to do that for other people as well and you know hopefully
get to the point where playing 510 1020 maybe 25 and a quarter and you know
playing only three times a week and just helping other people the rest of the week awesome that sounds great uh how
about we jump into some hands and go through and you can give your thought process and then I'll give some quick feedback awesome sounds good firsthand
here can you walk us through what's going on and this is a 51020 game just so everybody knows hold a manager just it it's not capable of putting a
straddle so it says there's a a $10 anti out there but it's actually 51020 can you walk us through what happens pre
flop here okay so First Act they limp and I'm in the cut off with Queen ten of
Hearts this is a hand where I think it's good enough to ISO and usually when the straddle on I size down just a tad bit
because people get a little more selective about their pre- flop hands when the amount of money is larger I
decide to ISO to uh 110 which is 5.5x the button who is a pretty special fish
very clicky w likes to play hands borderline whale calls and the trying rack calls and we go to a flap pretty
good for you you flap top two here and the limper checks it over so what are you thinking here on the flop in game I
was thinking that you know based on this button profile he's somebody who's going to be stabbing this board a lot and we
just have a really good hand and we want to put a lot of money in you know I think the problem with that that I
realized post game is even if we do check the button bets and we raise pretty much more than half the deck is
terrible for us and we're just going to be put in a really awkward spot so in hindsight I probably would have just bet
this for a pretty big size myself knowing there's so many inelastic hands and that's another thing that hhp has
really taught me is to focus on the elasticity and in elasticity of opponent's ranges because that's
ultimately a big driver in bed sizes so I did check here but I'm not sure I like my check in retrospect yeah one of the
things I would say here is when I am in position to one player and out of position to another player like we are
here I'm mostly just betting off my good hands because I think boards even wet Dynamic boards such as this one are just
not that likely to get stabbed when there's one player in position and then one player out of position because
people just don't stab as much multi- white now if you opened from the hijack and the cut off and button called here I
would be completely on board with just checking my range here and putting in some big check raises or if this was a
heads up pot Erse button and you describe the player as you know very clicky very stabby I would also be in favor of just checking my entire range
because I do think when it's heads up people just monkey stab but I think multi- way people are a little more
controlled with their stabs so I would kind of say my MO is if I think the board is greater than 50% to get stabbed
I'm just going to be checking everything but I think when it is three ways it's probably less it's probably
significantly less than 50% you went with the check here and unfortunately for you button checked it back we go to
turn which is an offsuit Ace and now the limper checks it over to you once again what are you thinking here in game so I
was you know really thinking about what the the limpers ranges you know most likely small medium pocket Pairs and
then you know maybe some weak suited Aces so Ace X of diamonds most likely
get stabbed at some point uh probably on the turn people just treat top pair of flush draws like they have quad so I
don't see that really getting checked again but you know I think a hand like some kind of wheel Ace suited wheel Ace
A7 suited something like that is pretty likely here from him the button maybe he
check back some a high uh he's a fish and a lot of fish do tend to have a lot of asex hands what I was thinking in
game was if I went kind of on the small side that the button would call with a bunch of kingx Jacka hands this size
it's pretty terrible for me and it really accomplishes nothing if I'm being honest but even if somebody who's progressed a lot in my game I'm not
immune to mistakes and I make them all the time but you know I really put an emphasis on learning from them and
getting better the medium size right we talk about like avoiding that medium size like you said because it usually doesn't accomplish much and if I was to
put a musket to your head and said hey man I'm going pull this musket if you don't get a s suited to fold here what
size would you bet to try to get A7 suited to fold here honestly probably be going pretty close to a 2X overb and
what about the hijack you know I would be going a little bit smaller it would probably be like 1.5x overb this guy
calls with A7 that the the musket gets fired uh considering the fact that I don't want to die just yet um you know
maybe maybe something about like 600 for the hijack and you know pushing just
above seven for the button this is a useful exercise always looking at the inverse if you're going 600 or 700 here to get A7 to fold well you could
probably be going at least 400 450 maybe even 500 to get asex to call right I
completely agree this was a very sloppy sizing in retrospect I you know probably would have pushed it to around the 400
450 Mark okay so button folds hijack calls we go to a river which is a queen
of diamonds hijack checks it over what are you thinking on the river this is a classic what happens if spot which is
you know an exercise that I learned from the stable it's based on what your opponent is going to do versus that sizing I don't think a trying wreck is
really limp calling much Queen X he's probably opening king queen maybe like a queen Jack Queen n suited which is two
combos so I think the majority of his range here is acex and a flush now what
happens if we bet small all his ax calls his flush is put in a check raise his
Queen X calls the small amount that he has what happens if we bet medium flushes call Queen X calls maybe some ax
calls now if we go large here his ax is folding Queen X maybe calls and flushes
call So based on that I decided to go with a small bet because it just sounds like it's getting it's getting the most
value from you know the majority of his range uh you know his flushes are going to put the money in for me and then his
other hands you know I'm just getting that guaranteed money from so that's kind of what led me to a small sizing
here so you go small enough on this river that an A7 suited never folds if he does have a flush here that hand just
always puts in more money that hand always check raises yeah yeah and that's why I took a really small sizing here
you know expecting even a h like five six of diamonds to you know just put in a value check raise yeah I really like
how you played the river I think there's you know obviously there's some qualms to pick with the Flop and turn that you
yourself outlined really well but I I I I really love the size on the river and the what happens if game is always super
useful to walk through those possibilities and I think one of the things that you've gotten excellent at is immediately bucketing your opponent's
range and just saying hey these are the three types of hands they have on the river they have asex they have flushes they have queenex those are the three
types of hands and they don't really have much queenex right so it's either asex or flushes how do those hands respond to different sizes and doing
that so quickly I mean your thought process like you walk through that in 15 seconds which is something you can definitely use in game that's just a
result of you know listening to everything you guys taught me doing a lot of work off the table when you're implementing new strategies learning new
strategies to not just be like oh well I know this I can go apply it perfectly you can't at least I can't I'm not you
know some kind of savant I had to work really really hard and as a result of that hard work you know those things
come pretty naturally to me now hey guys real quick if you want to be like Alex and triple your win rate if you're getting value from this video all I ask
please hit that subscribe button hit the thumbs up it boosts this in the algorithm and lets me know you guys want
more videos like this thank you guys and have a gentle day oh should we do uh let's jump into the next one yeah
absolutely once again this hand is 5 1020 as you see holder manager just not capable of doing the straddle so there's
a 10 and then a $10 Dead uh walk us through pre flop on this one I opened to 4X here uh probably could have pushed
this a little bit more but forehanded I really want somebody to call here so I
raised the 4X and the button is the only caller all right so the button calls and
we go to a flap and thoughts on the Flop here single race pot heads up out of position I had just play a hand with
this guy where he took a bet check bet line against me with a very very weak
Ace on an ace high board and he has pretty clear bet sizing tells I decided
to go with a check which is something that I do pretty often versus people who I think are going to give me a lot of
information based on their sizing so that led me to a check here now I'm not sure in retrospect if that was the best
decision cuz we have a hand that like even if they bet we don't really feel great about check raising you know a one
pair hand on this kind of board this deep so I think in hindsight I probably would have just bet this myself for a
pretty large sizing knowing that he has so many hands that are in elastic that aren't folding you know to one bet for
that reason I did go with the check to get the information from him I Hungry Horse we Advocate checking range single
race pots out of position because Live players in general over stab Telegraph their hand strength with their sizing and do not protect their checkback range
but in this particular spot like you said so clearly like when we have Aces here we don't really have a hand that wants to play for all the money big
blinds deep at this spr in a single race pot just going bet bet bet may be the highest EV option trying to get called
by like a king queen type hand and also like all boards are over stabbed but I would say these King High boards are the
least over stabbed because just people put you on Ace King and they will check back some King X sometimes on these
boards whereas on other boards if the board was Jack high or queen high or ten high they would just almost never check back top pair now if we had a hand like
pocket eights here I would still be checking because that's a hand that really benefits from going for a massive
check rise and trying to play a two Street game here if possible now if we have eights they can have a hand like Jack X of hearts or queen 10 of hearts
or 910 of hearts or King Jack that just is going to Pile in money and we can just get the money in right away I would
be checking here with a lot of my big draws as well just trying to apply Max fold Equity by going for that check raise but I think the deviation I would
make here is when we do have thick value if that makes sense you know I think I got my incentives maybe a little bit confused here I think my thoughts that
led me to a check were reasonable and you know I just don't think I really planned out the hand as well as I could
have hand gets a little funky later on as a result of me check calling so okay so you check and he goes $30 here on the
Flop thoughts I have a hand that doesn't really want to play for all the money and his range is most likely very weak
so if I check race I'm just going to fold out a weak range so for that reason I decided to call planning to bet a lot
of turns okay so you go for the call now the turn is a 10 and you took a very
unorthodox line here can you talk about why you decided to lead very small on this turn he massively overfolded to me
he views me as very tight I don't even know if he thinks I'm capable of bluffing so I thought it would be like
kind of a disaster if I went kind of big and this guy just folds like King 2 King three which actually probably isn't
happening even if we go bigger I want to keep in hands you know maybe like 10 n
uh Queen 10 that are going to be pretty price sensitive I still think I could have probably pushed this to at least
100 I'm just not sure how much King X he had like king deuce or King for suited or whatever when he bets $30 on the Flop
I would say this is mostly going to be like weaker draws and like Jack X would be my guess here a lot of those draws
now are like pair plus draws and if he has a pair plus an open and straight draw I would just be very very doubtful
that he would fold even to a bigger bet on this turn so I'd just be probably targeting like the pair plus straight
draw port of his range and I would probably size somewhere around pot here just targeting like Queen Jack or 109 or
89 or something like that you know maybe I just overestimated you know this guy's
capacity to fold to me and thought that this sliver of kingx that maybe he does have given the fact that he did bet
check bet versus me earlier with a weak top pair I I don't think it's folding to a larger bet and like you said there's
so many inelastic hands so targeting those hands just really makes a lot of sense I I agree that this turn sizing
was not the best okay so he calls we go to a river which pairs the board and is
a Jack of Hearts walk me through your thoughts here on this River I do think he can have some flushes I think you
know he does maybe go small with some middling flush draws on the Flop he can definitely have some Jacka Here you know
there is a sliver of King X in his range you know the king X isn't going to bet itself the Jack X if we go small enough
here is going to raise the flushes if we go small are going to raise but the one thing that I don't really think he ever
has here is a boat talk about why you don't think he has a boat what hands that go small on the Flop end up
becoming a boat Jack 10 and that's maybe the one boat he could possibly have here
but you know this is a guy who's pretty aggressive pre flop he's going to three bet pocket 10 he's absolutely not
betting 1th pot with pocket a not betting one fifth pot with King Jack so you know I I think Jack 10 is really the
only hand and you know given our very small turn size I actually think like
Jack 10 might raise that size at a decent frequency on the turn so in my
opinion like this guy really just doesn't have a boat so like if we bet small here he's going to raise with
flushes he's going to raise with Jack a but he never has a boat and he's going to call with King X and then we can do
some pretty pretty crazy stuff if he puts in a raise versus our small bat
okay so you decide to block here targeting a weak King maybe even a 10 that gets a little bit sticky what
happens here if you check I'm just kind of curious of weighing those two options as well so if we check here I think he
checks back a king bets Jack X I think he bets a flush but we just never get
the value from a king Okay cool so you decide to block targeting the king X and he puts in a pretty small raise less
than 3x here to 350 what does this mean in your eyes I think if he had a boat he would just get greedy hoping I have a
flush this is something that I relied on too much before hhp it's probably
something that I shouldn't really focus on is that he can't have the nut flush given my specific hand so at best he has
a queen High flush which I still think probably gets a little greedier so now his range is just Jacka and baby flushes
he thinks we're tight he doesn't even probably think we're capable of running it I'm turning my hand into a bluff and
I'm taking a size to get a range fold here I don't think having the Ace of carts is all that relevant because like
you said like would he bet this size on the Flop with an ace high flesh draw
would he raise this size on the river with an ace high flush like I just I just think we have two napkins here I
think in this spot actually just no blockers are really relevant because like you said he just he doesn't really have a full house or doesn't really have
a nut flush here what ultimately does have relevance here is his sizing on the Flop his small raise on the river and
the fact that he didn't raise the turn versus a very small size so all that leads me to yeah this guy just really
doesn't have a boat and he doesn't have a good flush yes so to be clear here if he did have like a nine High flush here
what size would you go to get that hand to call probably about like 1350 1,400 mhm so you'd go for the BET three bet to
around 1350 here to Ure like a nine High flush calls I probably wouldn't take this line if I had a flush um I probably
wouldn't go for a bet three bet I would probably just bet bigger myself on the river this is a spot where I probably
would have never gotten in this situation yeah and I completely understand that I just I just think the thought exercise is still useful like
what size would you go like because if we could figure out what size we would go here with value to get a nine High flush or a six High flush to call on
this River well now we have a really easy time calibrating what size we would go here to get those hands to fold and I
think it's so so useful to distance the forest from the trees because everybody myself included like we have a hard time
like calibrating on this River what size do we need to bet to get a nine High flesh to fold but it's really easy if
you just if you just ask the in well if I did have value here what size would I raise to get a n High flesh to call it
at least helps you hold logical consistency when you can run into a brick wall when he does have boats in
this spot you need to be super careful with your calibration you want to be efficient you want to choose that size
well I'd go 1350 to get a 9 high flesh to call so maybe in this spot I would go 1,700 1,800 to get it to fold and then I
lose the minimum when he doesn't have a boat but in this particular spot as we talked about he just never really has a boat he just never really has a big
flush so you're not really worried about running into a brick wall at that point you don't really need to be all that efficient with your bluff sizing if he's
never going to call you may as well air on the side of going too big where you need to be efficient with your bluff sizing is when they do have some brick
walls that you run into that are just never folding maybe a sliver of my Risa version did slip in here that's why I
didn't Jam but given the very small likelihood that he does I did size up a
little bit above that 17 1800 and made it 2K here you know if I really thought this through and figured out he never
has a boat I probably would have just jammed yeah I think I think he found a super interesting line on this River one
of my favorite lines here on Rivers when I have thin value is to just block very
very small and then when they raise we now have options and we can go for that bet three bet and actually turn our hand
into a bluff so I think this is a super creative line it's actually it's one of my favorite lines right is block for thin value on the river and if they call
we're good and if they raise well we can often turn our hand into a bet three bet Bluff and bet 3 betting I found on the
river generates more fold Equity than betting ourselves and it generates more fold what even just check raising it
looks so so strong and I personally have gotten people to fold some ridiculous Hands On The River by going for the BET
3 Bet Bluff so I think this is a super creative line on this River from you just planning to block and then go for
the BET three bet I really like the way you play this River thank you all right so let's do one more hand here walk us through pre flop he opened in the hijack
and he was pretty active you know opening all sorts of stuff uh we're pretty deep we have a hand that's
probably pretty cuspy in terms of the hands that I would three bet but given the fact that we're deep I have a big
Edge I don't think he's going to for bet me very much and we get to play in position this all led me towards a three
bet so I put in the three bet to ISO a guy uh where I think I have an incentive to ISO him and he ends up making the
call okay just just one little note on this three bet and yeah I mean it is it maybe it is looks a little cuspy by like
200 big blind or 300 big blind equilibrium charts from the hijack here from out of position he is supposed to
be for betting almost all the time or at least a high frequency with hands like Ace Queen suited Ace Jack suited king
queen suited 10 n suited and I would just argue that like from out of position like those hands just almost
never get forb and so what happens when people start massively under four
betting it just means you get to realize so much more being the in position three better you know I don't even see a lot
of recreational players for betting Ace King so like when they're literally for betting you with just the mega knuts it
just makes your life so easy and it makes your decisions so easy and you can just LOL fold so many hands if you do
get four bets so all that definitely led me to a three bet here this is supposed to be the hijacks range and I don't have
300 big blind ranges solved but this is for 200 big blinds and you see here the hijack versus the cuto off is supposed
to be for betting just a super wide range from out of position Ace Queen suited 77% of the time Ace Jack nearly
50 king queen suited 36% of the time I mean even hands like Jack 10s are supposed to be forb bet at a pretty high
frequency they're just supposed to punish you when you three bet by going super linear from out of position and just for betting all their good hands
and I would just argue that this just doesn't happen so you just get the three bet kind of with impunity here in the
cut off because they're just not going to punish you by four betting he calls and we go to a flop which is beautiful
for you 664 you flopped it yep flopped it and he checks it over what are your thoughts versus fish I pretty much just
range bet 1/3 uh 100% frequency and this is a spot where you know um there are
situations where I'll deviate right so like an example of where I might deviate here is let's say I had a hand like
pocket aces I might just go pretty big here if this guy has pocket sevens or pocket eights he has an overpair in his
mind he's not folding and I want to get the value from those hands right now but this is a hand where like we don't
really benefit from doing that and we want to keep his range as wide as possible going to Future streets cuz
it's really a lot easier to Bluff a wider weaker range so I decided just go with the range bet here keep his range
nice and wide we talk a lot about choosing the size where they raise off their strong [ __ ] and call what their weak [ __ ] and on this particular board
they're just isn't really much strong [ __ ] like when he opens in the hijack and call he just doesn't really have any 6X here I guess he can have pocket fours
but that hand is kind of invulnerable I'm not even sure how often that hand would fast play I think one of the important things you mentioned he just has a lot of hands here like sevens
eights nines 10 Jacks and those hands are never going to be putting in a raise at a high frequency even if we bet small
here so if we do have a really good hand like Aces or Kings or something like that we may just want to size up because if he's never folding pocket sevens here
to 2/3 pot well we may as well just size up and then when we are bluffing here yeah we can sometimes just size down to
make sure that he calls on this flop with a hand like Ace King or a hand like Ace Jack of clubs or something like that
that isn't going to be able to hang on and withstand pressure on most runouts he calls we go to a turn which is an ace
of hearts he checks it over and give me your thoughts here on this turn he can definitely have some flushes well one of
the big things I noticed with the fish meta right is they don't like when the board Pairs and they don't like when the
flush gets there we want to take a size that keeps those pairs with a hard in and forces him to raise off his flushes
it's not many flushes but they do exist and you know we really want to make sure we're not running into a brick wall
going to the river this is a river depending on the run out where we can just get a range fold so we want to also
leave a pretty chunky spr okay so we go 250 here just choosing the size it's going to incentivize him to raise off
when he does have a flush like you talked about so he is going to call we go to a river which is the innocuous eight of spades and he checks it over I
really felt like I had two options here I could bet kind of like on the medium side here 750 800ish just targeting
pairs with a heart draw and getting all those to fold what that doesn't fold is the ACX hands that he has in his range
doesn't have a flush he would erased that off on the turn uh I don't really think he's going to check call check
call check River with a boat you know one of the characteristics that we discuss is fish can't delay Gra
ification and fish get greedy so like they're not capable of just check call check call checking a river with a boat
here so basically at this point my thinking is that like his best hand is
Ace King I did think somebody is not really going to want to call a 2.5x
overb especially for a large amount of money with a one pair hand all that led me to going for it thinking we would get
a range fold yeah and that that is super interesting because I would assume that a lot of the time a hand like king would
fold in this particular spot I do think the medium size does have some Merit
because I think the majority of his range getting to this river is going to be hands like pocket t with a heart or pocket Jacks with a heart and if we were
trying to make pocket Jacks with a heart call on this River we may have to bet like $200 or something like ridiculously
small so I think we could just bet like 400 or 500 on this River and get 90% of his range to fold which is nines 10
Jacks even Queens with a heart something like that all those hands fold here for like 400 or 500 I don't really think he
has any Ace X getting to this River besides specifically Ace King because if you think about it the hands that would
float the Flop what are they hoping to beat they just put us on Ace King so I think Ace Queen just like folds to flop
a lot so it's really like Ace King or he doesn't really have acex on this River if we think we can get Ace King to fold
here 100% of the time jamming here on this River super super nice also think that Medium siiz should strongly be
considered here 400 500 just getting all of those middling pocket pairs to fold one thing I will say specifically when
the Ace of Hearts is on the board and the board pairs sometimes recreational players will get into this mindset that
you don't really have any fleshes because all your flushes are ace high flushes when the board pairs that you may not go for this huge size with a
flush because the board is paired because they wouldn't go for this huge size and if they have Ace King here
really hard for you to have a boat specifically a hand like pocket aces you probably wouldn't play a hand like
pocket eights this way it's just kind of hard for them to put you on a hand that they lose to when they do have a hand
like Ace King here now most recreational players aren't thinking that deeply but if you are playing against kind of a try
wreck I would definitely keep that in mind so I do think that 400 to 500 sizing on this River has a ton of Merit
just trying to get pocket Jacks with a heart to fold maybe I didn't fully understand this opponent's thought
process cuz in my mind you know I did think he would put us on the flush here it was kind of funny during the hand he
was talking out loud he's like you don't three bet king queen of hearts and I'm in my head I'm like yes I do yes I do
and uh you know uh you know I kind of knew he was eventually going to call when he starts
saying that said he's going to have to learn a lesson but ultimately it was me who learned the lesson here so he ends
up calling with Ace King here don't don't overuse this and don't go crazy with this but if a recreational player
is thinking about calling here on this River you think they're going to call one of the things I would say on this river is I don't have king queen of
hearts 99.9% of the time when a recreational player tells you I don't have this value hand and eliminates a
value hand from the range they're only willing to eliminate a value hand from the range when they specifically have
value so that is a sign of strength I like to flip that tell in reverse and
use it when I'm bluffing and I found like that tell for whatever reason just projects kind of strength and I have
gotten a few people I've kind of talked them off the ledge when they look like they were calling by just eliminating a value hand from my range they're like oh
he doesn't have king queen of hearts well he doesn't seem to be worried about telling me he doesn't have the King High well [ __ ] what does he have then and
they kind of like they get a little bit more nervous and don't put too much stock in that but it is just it's something I've I've tried that has worked pretty well against recreational
players ultimately I don't want to be too results oriented here I think versus a large majority of opponents this is a
play that's going to work and I think you know maybe I didn't understand my opponent enough maybe didn't realize he
was trying as hard as he is cuz I think recreational players here are going to just think I have a flush or a really
good hand and be too risk averse to put all the money in with a top Air hand all right thanks Alex these were some these
were some fun hands and I would say definitely at this point like coming from a player who used to be risk averse
you are not playing anywhere near risk averse so I think that's it's a massive step and like we've been able to see that reflected in your win rate for sure
pretty pretty cool to see yeah it's been awesome um you know I still have to fight the little devil on my shoulder
every time I go play but you know logically these plays work Skyrocket in my win rate ultimately logic trumps
emotion uh like I said working on all those mental game things and really figuring out what is the the most
profitable play I'm so grateful to you Mark I'm so grateful to Hungry Horse and you know I hope anybody watching this
can get something from it and realize that you know if I can go from being a [ __ ] R knit making $30 an hour to just a
pretty much beating up everyone at 510 and you know hopefully bigger soon you
